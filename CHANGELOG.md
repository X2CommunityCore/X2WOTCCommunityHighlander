- Able to list classes to be excluded from being 'needed', which means they are
  rarely meant to be acquired via Rookie level up and instead trained (#113)

- Renable the ability to add positive traits in codebase, as well as additional
  filtering and behaviour on the various Trait Functions on `XComGameState_Unit`
  (#85)
- Allow mods to register custom OnInput UI handlers (#198)

### Improvements
- Create a mod friendly way to manipulate loot tables (#8)
- Allow to specify EventListenerDeferral Priority for EventListeners registered
  X2EventListenerTemplates. Also allow to remove registered Listeners. (#4)
- Allow enemies with assigned names to have them appear as their name, rather
  than a generic label. (#52)

  hardcoding based on Rookie Rank (#55)
- Change UIUtilities_Colors.GetColorForFaction to use Faction template color as
  a backup (#72)
- Prevent items from stacking if they have ComponentObjects attached to them,
  useful for mods to create uniques out of stackable items. (#104)

- Rebuild PerkContentCache during OnPostTemplatesCreated to improve handling for
  PerkContent attachments to Units (#123)

  (#150)

  random roll from specific part names (#155)

- Improve performance by removing unnecessary calls to UpdateAllMeshMaterials (#186)

### Fixes

  Shadowstep Strength in the narrative mission, instead Shadowstep is forced
  ahead of awarding the remaining traits, so the trait roll takes the strength
  into account (#51)
- Enable ForceCountry in CharacterPoolManager - was ignored despite being
  an argument in the CreateCharacter function (#70)
- Fixes game terminating SoundCue narrative moments after three seconds because
  it assumes they didn't play at all. (#66)
