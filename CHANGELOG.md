  subsequent shots (#20)

### Event Hooks

### Modding Exposures

### Improvements
- Create a mod friendly way to manipulate loot tables (#8)
- Allow to specify EventListenerDeferral Priority for EventListeners registered
  X2EventListenerTemplates. Also allow to remove registered Listeners. (#4)
- Allow enemies with assigned names to have them appear as their name, rather
  than a generic label. (#52)
- Check a soldiers 'NeedsSecondaryWeapon' in UIArmory_Loadout, rather than
  hardcoding based on Rookie Rank (#55)
- Change UIUtilities_Colors.GetColorForFaction to use Faction template color as
  a backup (#72)

### Fixes
- Fix Chosen Assassin receiving weaknesses that are exclusive to the
  Shadowstep Strength in the narrative mission, instead Shadowstep is forced
  ahead of awarding the remaining traits, so the trait roll takes the strength
  into account (#51)
- Enable ForceCountry in CharacterPoolManager - was ignored despite being
  an argument in the CreateCharacter function (#70)
- Fixes game terminating SoundCue narrative moments after three seconds because
  it assumes they didn't play at all. (#66)
