# Change Log
All notable changes to Vanilla 'War Of The Chosen' Behaviour will be documented in this file.

## General

### Ini settings

#### Mod compatibility

In `XComGame.ini` mods can specify an array of incompatible and/or required mods. This will be used to show an warning popup if they are present. (#524)

```
[ModSafeName CHModDependency]
+IncompatibleMods=OtherModSafeName
+IgnoreIncompatibleMods=OtherModSafeName
+RequiredMods=OtherModSafeName
+IgnoreRequiredMods=OtherModSafeName
DisplayName="Fancy Mod"
```

#### DLC Run Order

In `XComGame.ini` mods can define an array of other mods which dlc hooks should run before and/or after the mods dlc hook.
LoadPriority can be RUN_STANDARD, RUN_FIRST or RUN_LAST. RunBefore and RunAfter only work within the defined LoadPriority group. Only change load priority if you really sure that its needed for you mod (#511)
```
[ModSafeName CHDLCRunOrder]
+RunBefore=OtherModSafeName
+RunAfter=OtherModSafeName
RunPriorityGroup=RUN_STANDARD
```

### Modding Exposures
- Allows mods to add custom items to the Avenger Shortcuts (#163)
- UIScanButton now calls OnMouseEventDelegate (#483). Note: DO NOT call ProcessMouseEvents, just set the delegate directly
- Remove `private` from `X2AIBTBehaviorTree.Behaviors` so that mods can change the behavior trees without
  overwriting all the necessary entries (#410)

### Configuration
- Allow disabling of Factions being initialized on startup by
  `XComGameState_HeadquartersResistance`, as it can break if it collect custom
  factions and then assigns Chosen to them instead of the base game factions.
  (#82)
- Allow specifying Second Wave options for Strategy Debug Start (#197)
- bDontUnequipCovertOps prevents soldiers gear gets stripped when sending on covert op with no ambush risk (#153)
- bDontUnequipWhenWounded prevents soldiers gear gets stripped when getting wounded (#310)
- iDefaultWeaponTint allows to configure the default weappon tint for randomly generated soldiers (#397)
- AdditionalAmbushRiskTemplates array represents risk templates that the game will consider at risk to ambush (#485)
- bSkipCampaignIntroMovies skips the intro movies on campaign start (#543)

### Improvements
- Allow `UIStrategyMap` to display custom Faction HQ icons (#76)
- Allow customization of auto-equipment removal behavior in 'UISquadSelect' (#134)
- Class mods adding an eight rank will now interact better with classes with seven ranks (#1)
- Allow `XComGameState_WorldRegion::DestinationReached` to use any XCGS_GeoscapeEntity class (#443)
- Add AmbushMissionSource name property to XComGameState_CovertAction; mods can now specify the ambush mission on creation of Action GameState (#485)
- Customization localizations now picked up for Torso/Legs/Arms. If the TemplateName already
  contains the parttype name (ie Torso/Legs/Arms), then the object name in the localization file
  matches as for other parts (in particular this means Anarchy's Children localizations which already exist in the files
  are picked up automatically). Otherwise, "_Torso"/"_Legs"/"_Arms" is appended to the template name
  to create the unique object name. (#328)

### Fixes
- Fix an issue in base game where strategy X2EventListenerTemplates only
  register on tactical->strategy transfer, not when loading directly into
  strategy (#3)
- Fix GetCrossClassAbilities collecting abilities that are already in that
  particular Unit Class's skill tree (#30, #62)
- Fix Loadout utility items when unit has an item equipped in the Ammo Pocket (#99)
- Fix units unequipping items they shouldn't, resulting in duplicate Paired Weapons (#189)
- Fix all Covert Actions from being removed when generating covert actions (#435)
- Fix a pathing issue in base game with "flying" pod leaders where non-flat tiles on their
  paths prevent them from patrolling (#503)

  filtering and behaviour on the various Trait Functions on `XComGameState_Unit`

  hardcoding based on Rookie Rank (#55)

  a backup (#72)

- Rebuild PerkContentCache during OnPostTemplatesCreated to improve handling for
  PerkContent attachments to Units (#123)
- Check DLCInfo for `CanAddItemToInventory` no matter what, rather than short
  circuiting if DisabledReason != "" (#127)

  inventory slots (#118, #137)
- Fix UIOptionsPCScreen so part pack sliders actually get shown as intended
  (#150)
- Fix XGCharacterGenerator so it's actually possible to disable part packs for
  new soldiers (#154)

  random roll from specific part names (#155)

  eliminating the need for head mods to include invisible heads (#219)

- For "Legacy Operations" changes to squad members' Soldier Class, and changes to the Soldier Classes themselves, are taken into account for pre-existing operations.
  Particularly important for Central and Shen, whose custom Soldier Classes ability tree contain only the abilities granted by their squad progression (#307)
- Better Photobooth support for custom Soldier Classes and Spark-like units,
  no broken duo poses for units that can't play them (#309)
- Additional Photobooth particle system enums for mods (#359)
- Tweaks to "Resistance Archives" random Legacy Operations UI. Restarts show the correct locked difficulty, and a crash condition on backing out of a restart fixed. (#307)
- Added CovertAction as its own EventSource on Event 'CovertActionCompleted' (#383)
- "Arms" no longer always hide forearm decos, but obey the archetype flag as the left/right arms do. (#350)
- Arms and left/right arm customization dropdowns remain selectable even if they only have one entry
  iff both arms and seperate left/right arms are available. (#350)
- Allow mods to check whether VIP units left a mission successfully via the `bRemovedFromPlay`
  flag on `XComGameState_Unit`. This behavior is gated behind the new `CHHelpers.PreserveProxyUnitData`
  config variable. (#465)
- Adds CustomDeathAnimationName property to X2Action_Death that allows overriding the default death animations (#488)

### Fixes
- Fix Chosen Assassin receiving weaknesses that are exclusive to the
  Shadowstep Strength in the narrative mission, instead Shadowstep is forced
  ahead of awarding the remaining traits, so the trait roll takes the strength
  into account (#51)
- Enable ForceCountry in CharacterPoolManager - was ignored despite being
  an argument in the CreateCharacter function (#70)
- Fixes game terminating SoundCue narrative moments after three seconds because
  it assumes they didn't play at all. (#66)
- Fixes UIPanels animating in with a huge delay when they are direct child panels of
  UIScreen (#341)
- Appearances now update correctly when a part change differs only by material override (#354)
- All relevant body parts are now correctly validated when the torso is changed. (#350)
