## General

### Ini settings

#### Mod compatibility

In `XComGame.ini` mods can specify an array of incompatible and/or required mods. This will be used to show an warning popup if they are present. (#524)

```
[ModSafeName CHModDependency]
+IncompatibleMods=OtherModSafeName
+IgnoreIncompatibleMods=OtherModSafeName
+RequiredMods=OtherModSafeName
+IgnoreRequiredMods=OtherModSafeName
DisplayName="Fancy Mod"
```

#### DLC Run Order

In `XComGame.ini` mods can define an array of other mods which dlc hooks should run before and/or after the mods dlc hook.
LoadPriority can be RUN_STANDARD, RUN_FIRST or RUN_LAST. RunBefore and RunAfter only work within the defined LoadPriority group. Only change load priority if you really sure that its needed for you mod (#511)
