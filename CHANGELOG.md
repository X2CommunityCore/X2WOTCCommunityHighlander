  skills (#80)
- Able to list classes to be excluded from being 'needed', which means they are
  rarely meant to be acquired via Rookie level up and instead trained (#113)

  filtering and behaviour on the various Trait Functions on `XComGameState_Unit`
  (#85)

- Able to specify new materials as counting as hair/skin/armour/weapons etc. for the purpose of
  receiving tints, patterns, tattoos etc. (#356)

### Improvements
- Create a mod friendly way to manipulate loot tables (#8)
- Allow to specify EventListenerDeferral Priority for EventListeners registered
  X2EventListenerTemplates. Also allow to remove registered Listeners. (#4)
- Allow enemies with assigned names to have them appear as their name, rather
  than a generic label. (#52)
- Check a soldiers 'NeedsSecondaryWeapon' in UIArmory_Loadout, rather than
  hardcoding based on Rookie Rank (#55)
- Change UIUtilities_Colors.GetColorForFaction to use Faction template color as
  a backup (#72)
- Prevent items from stacking if they have ComponentObjects attached to them,
  useful for mods to create uniques out of stackable items. (#104)
- Allow to define mutually exclusive abilities (#128) like `Template.PrerequisiteAbilities.AddItem('NOT_SomeAbility');`
- Rebuild PerkContentCache during OnPostTemplatesCreated to improve handling for
  PerkContent attachments to Units (#123)
- Check DLCInfo for `CanAddItemToInventory` no matter what, rather than short
  circuiting if DisabledReason != "" (#127)

  inventory slots (#118, #137)
- Fix UIOptionsPCScreen so part pack sliders actually get shown as intended
  (#150)
- Fix XGCharacterGenerator so it's actually possible to disable part packs for
  new soldiers (#154)
- Alter XComGameState_Unit so it obeys part pack sliders when picking new armour
  appearances. Use `CHHelpers.CosmeticDLCNamesUnaffectedByRoll` to remove the 
  random roll from specific part names (#155)
- `eInvSlot_HeavyWeapon` is now a multi-item slot (#171)
- Improve performance by removing unnecessary calls to UpdateAllMeshMaterials (#186)
- Adds ability to have weapon upgrades modify damage, and properly accounts for
  any damage upgrades in the UI. (#237)
- Allow Human Pawns to freely switch between custom heads and base pawn heads,
  eliminating the need for head mods to include invisible heads (#219)
- Changes to "Legacy Operations" squad loadout and ability selections are now always applied for the first mission. Note any non-AWC-eligble abilities added need to exist in the Soldier Classes ability tree (#307)
- For "Legacy Operations" changes to squad members' Soldier Class, and changes to the Soldier Classes themselves, are taken into account for pre-existing operations.
  Particularly important for Central and Shen, whose custom Soldier Classes ability tree contain only the abilities granted by their squad progression (#307)
- Better Photobooth support for custom Soldier Classes and Spark-like units,
  no broken duo poses for units that can't play them (#309)
- Additional Photobooth particle system enums for mods (#359)
- Tweaks to "Resistance Archives" random Legacy Operations UI. Restarts show the correct locked difficulty, and a crash condition on backing out of a restart fixed. (#307)


### Fixes
- Fix Chosen Assassin receiving weaknesses that are exclusive to the
  Shadowstep Strength in the narrative mission, instead Shadowstep is forced
  ahead of awarding the remaining traits, so the trait roll takes the strength
  into account (#51)
- Enable ForceCountry in CharacterPoolManager - was ignored despite being
  an argument in the CreateCharacter function (#70)
- Fixes game terminating SoundCue narrative moments after three seconds because
  it assumes they didn't play at all. (#66)
- Fixes UIPanels animating in with a huge delay when they are direct child panels of
  UIScreen (#341)
