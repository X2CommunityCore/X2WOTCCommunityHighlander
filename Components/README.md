# X2WOTCCommunityHighlander Components

Components are a way to replace DLC script packages using a separate workshop mod.
Shipping `DLC_2.u` / `DLC_3.u` / `TLE.u` in the main CHL mod
**will have adverse side effects for users without the DLC**
if some other mod references classes from the DLC packages.
See [#803](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander/issues/803) for more details.

So, we ship a separate mod (for each DLC).
