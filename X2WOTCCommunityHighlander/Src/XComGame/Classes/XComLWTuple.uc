//  FILE:    XComLWTuple.uc
//  AUTHOR:  tracktwo / Pavonis Interactive
//  PURPOSE: A general-purpose data structure for sharing information between mods.
//
// == DESCRIPTION ==
//
// LWTuple can be used to pass information between two mods without those mods needing to 
// share any additional class types. Typically this information is passed using the XCOM2
// event system: an event trigger passes an LWTuple as the EventData, and the listeners
// can retreive this LWTuple. Data can be passed in both directions through this system,
// and the only type they both need to know about is LWTuple.
//
// LWTuples contain an id (a name) and an array of LWTValue values. The name is 
// arbitrary and can be used to allow the sender and receiver to validate they are working
// with the tuple they are expecting. The data array holds the actual data to pass.
//
// LWTValue values are a union-like structure, similar to the ASValue struct used by the 
// Scaleform system. A value can hold a bool, int, float, string, name, or object. Values 
// are used by setting the field corresponding to the type you wish to store (e.g. i for
// int) and setting the kind field to the corresponding enum value (LWTVInt in this case).
// Readers should read only the field corresponding to the kind set in the value. 
//
// To use a tuple with the event system, the code firing the event should "new" a LWTuple,
// set its ID field to an appropriate name, optionally fill in any information needed by
// the event listeners, and pass it as the EventData for the event.
//
// Listeners should cast the EventData back to a LWTuple, validate that the result is not
// none, that its ID is the one they are expecting, and that any contents are as expected. 
// They can then store any new data needed into the tuple by adding to the data array before
// returning from the listener. These listeners should typically use ELDImmediate as their
// deferral mode so that the results are immediately processed and passed back to the caller,
// although mods may advertise longer-lived tuples that can be processed with other 
// deferral strategies.
//
// Note that since multiple mods can all be listening on the same event there may be multiple
// mods receiving the same tuple. If more than one mod needs to return data in a tuple that
// was not intended to receive data from more than one mod a conflict occurs and these mods
// may be incompatible.
//
// == USAGE ==
//
// To make use of LWTuple in your mods, create a subfolder LW_Tuple under your mod's Src
// folder, and a Classes folder under LW_Tuple. Copy this source file into that folder and
// add it to your project. Then add the following lines to your XComEngine.ini config file:
//
// [UnrealEd.EditorEngine]
// +ModEditPackages=LW_Tuple
//
// You can then refer to the LWTuple and LWTValue types in your code.
//
// DO NOT CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF THIS FILE IN YOUR MOD. In order for this system to work
// all mods must agree on the definition of LWTuple. Different definitions of LWTuple in
// different mods may lead to bugs or crashes.
