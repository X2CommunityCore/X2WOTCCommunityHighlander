<h1>Compatibility</h1>

Because the Highlander is a core mod that many different mods on the workshop depend on,
it strives to not make any observable changes to the base game (save for bug fixes and features
that mods explicitly make use of). However, everything can *potentially* be a breaking change
because the existing behavior rarely has any documentation in the game. Additionally, `ModClassOverrides`
in mods occasionally override functions that were changed in the Highlander, essentially reverting the
change and breaking a Highlander feature. As a result, sometimes modders need to pay special attention to
Highlander features. This page is a list of pages tagged `compatibility`, indicating a potential incompatibility.

Every page listed here has an section *Compatibility* that describes the issue and how modders can fix it.
