It will take us a while to document all old features, but it is expected that new features all come with their documentation page. How to read The nav bar has a list of features. Click on a feature to view that feature's documentation. Every feature has: A GitHub tracking issue for discussion A documented way to use it, for example with an event tuple Code references that link to HL source code where the documentation is Documentation for the documentation tool We place our documentation inside of the source code next to where the main change for the given feature is. make_docs.py extracts this documentation and renders MarkDown pages, which MkDocs in turn renders to a web page. You can run the documentation tool locally by installing Python (recommended version 3.7) and running python .\\.scripts\\make_docs.py --indirsfile .\\docs_directories.txt --outdir .\\target\\ --docsdir .\\docs_src\\ --dumpelt .\\target\\CHL_Event_Compiletest.uc or the makeDocs task in VS Code. This creates Markdown files for the documentation; rendering HTML documentation requires MkDocs : pip install mkdocs cd .\\target\\ mkdocs serve Whenever the master branch is committed to, the documentation is built and deployed here. Additionally, upon opening or updating a Pull Request, the documentation is built and uploaded as a GitHub artifact. This can be used to easily check the resulting documentation for a Pull Request. Inline Documentation The core concept of the documentation script is \"features\". Documentation always relates to a given feature, and usually the feature name is the name of the function or event that is added. Every feature needs exactly one definition , and may have additional documentation scattered throughout other source files. Syntax Every block of comments starting with triple comment characters ( /// for UnrealScript files and ;;; for Ini files) and an optional whitespace character (space or tab) will be considered for documentation. Additionally, the first line must begin with HL-Docs: . All directly following lines that start with the same triple comment will be included until the first line that does not have that triple comment. Standard MarkDown syntax is expected and supported. You may include source code fragments directly from the game code by placing a single HL-Include: in an otherwise empty triple comment line; all following lines until the next triple comment line will be included as source code in the documentation. Feature definitions A feature definition has the following syntax: HL-Docs: feature:<string>; issue:<int>; tags:<string>,<string>... Feature references If you have defined a feature somewhere but want to reference other parts of the source code, or want to spread the documentation for a feature across different files, you may place a reference: HL-Docs: ref:<string> All text from the reference block will be appended to the main documentation as well. Complete example (Taken from ArmorEquipRollDLCPartChance ) XComGameState_Unit.uc : /// HL-Docs: feature:ArmorEquipRollDLCPartChance; issue:155; tags:customization,compatibility /// When a unit equips new armor, the game rolls from all customization options, even the ones where /// the slider for the `DLCName` is set to `0`. The HL change fixes this, but if your custom armor only /// has customization options with a `DLCName` set, the game may discard that `DLCName` (default: in 85% of cases) /// which results in soldiers without torsos. If you want to keep having `DLCName`-only armor /// (for example to display mod icons in `UICustomize`), you must disable that behavior /// by creating the following lines in `XComGame.ini`: /// /// ```ini /// [XComGame.CHHelpers] /// +CosmeticDLCNamesUnaffectedByRoll=MyDLCName /// ``` XComGame.ini : ;;; HL-Docs: ref:ArmorEquipRollDLCPartChance Tags You may tag your documentation with a number of built-in and custom tags. strategy and tactical are built-in tags used to categorize features in the navigation bar. If a feature has one tag and not the other, it'll land in that category. Otherwise, it'll land in the misc category. Custom tags can be used, but need a custom page that serves as an index page for that tag; for example the compatibility tag has a page docs_src/compatibility.md that describes what the tag is supposed to mean and (automatically generated) links to all features with that tag. Bugfixes The Bugfixes feature is owned by the documentation script and as such has no definition in the game code. It is used for generating a page listing all bugfixes that can be explained by a single line. It uses a slightly modified reference syntax: HL-Docs: ref:Bugfixes; issue:<int> <string> for example: /// HL-Docs: ref:Bugfixes; issue:70 /// `CharacterPoolManager:CreateCharacter` now honors ForceCountry Events The Highlander triggers some events to pass data to and receive data from mods. We document these events with a special syntax and automatically generate a copy-pasteable listener template that developers can simply copy into their mod and fill out. Additionally, that listener template is printed into a CHL source file so that it can be tested whether it successfully compiles. The syntax for events is the following ```event EventID: OverridePromotionUIClass, EventData: [in enum[CHLPromotionScreenType] PromotionScreenType, inout class[class<UIArmory_Promotion>] PromotionUIClass], EventSource: XComHQPresentationLayer (Pres), NewGameState: none ``` Entries need to be comma-separated EventData or EventSource specify the type, and then optionally in parentheses the variable name. EventData can be an XComLWTuple. In that case, use [ inout int a, ... ] Tuple parameters can be in , out , or inout In the template, in parameters will be copied from the tuple into a local property out parameters will be copied from a local property into the tuple inout parameters do both All XComLWTuple types are supported enum s can be typed with enum[EnumType] class es can be typed with class[class<Type>] If the type is not a primitive, it's assumed to be an object NewGameState needs to be one of three values: yes , maybe or none The above example generates the following code static function EventListenerReturn OnOverridePromotionUIClass(Object EventData, Object EventSource, XComGameState GameState, Name EventID, Object CallbackObject) { local XComHQPresentationLayer Pres; local XComLWTuple Tuple; local CHLPromotionScreenType PromotionScreenType; local class<UIArmory_Promotion> PromotionUIClass; Pres = XComHQPresentationLayer(EventSource); Tuple = XComLWTuple(EventData); PromotionScreenType = CHLPromotionScreenType(Tuple.Data[0].i); PromotionUIClass = class<UIArmory_Promotion>(Tuple.Data[1].o); // Your code here Tuple.Data[1].o = PromotionUIClass; return ELR_NoInterrupt; } All generated listeners will be dumped into CHL_Event_Compiletest.uc , which will only be included in normal compilation in \"compiletest\" tasks. CI automatically determines the changes your PR would make to that file and posts a comment containing the diff for reviewers (and you). This comment will be updated whenever the PR is updated. If you provide a better example listener, you can simply opt out of the template with ```event,notemplate .","title":"X2WOTCCommunityHighlander Documentation"},{"location":"#x2wotccommunityhighlander-documentation","text":"","title":"X2WOTCCommunityHighlander Documentation"},{"location":"#current-status-of-the-documentation","text":"The documentation is freshly introduced.

However, the slot still has navigator focus, and should remain highlighted. This only affects controllers since the mouse has moved off the button at this point. If a controller is active, don't let the game un-highlight it. #862 - UIStaffSlot.uc:405-408 : By default, UIStaffSlot will blink on and off a staff slot that \"loses\" focus when focus doesn't belong to it in the first place. Make sure to only change focus if the element is not already in the destination focus state #866 - UIStaffContainer.uc:58-60 : By default, UIStaffContainer tries to shortcut which UIPanel should receive focus, but the shortcut is often wrong and the time it saves is negligible, so this bypasses it. #879 - X2Ability.uc:883-884 : Use HistoryIndex to access the AbilityState as it was when the ability was activated rather than getting the most recent version. #879 - X2Ability.uc:902-903 : Use HistoryIndex to access the WeaponState as it was when the ability was activated rather than getting the most recent version. #880 - UIArmory_WeaponUpgrade.uc:750-751 : Remove unnecessary text coloring from the weapon pattern value text. #896 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:476-478 : Call the (hopefully) relevant delegate, if this weapon upgrade has it. This makes the guaranteed damage on missed shots added by Stocks properly benefit from Insider Knowledge #896 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:855-857 : Call the (hopefully) relevant delegate, if this weapon upgrade has it. This makes the guaranteed damage on missed shots added by Stocks properly benefit from Insider Knowledge #896 - X2Effect_LaserSight.uc:28-29 : Add bonus crit if Insider Knowledge is present. #924 - UIChoosePsiAbility.uc:211-212 : Prevent the psi ability training screen from showing duplicate abilities #927 - XComGameState_GeoscapeEntity.uc:311-314 : When cancelling out of squad select or mission launch, the selected map item will now return back to the mission rather than the Avenger (affects controller users). #952 - UIChosenInfo.uc:56-57 : Focus the top Chosen button when the screen is opened. #952 - UIChosenInfo.uc:431-432 : Fix typo in the MC function call. #990 - X2Ability_HackRewards.uc:736-738 : Trigger the hack reward ability only if it's present in the Game State. This prevents hack rewards from being granted multiple times. #1008 - XGAIBehavior.uc:10084-10086 : Entire pods no longer fail to scamper if the pod leader skips its turn, for example if it's immobilized. #1029 - SeqAct_SpawnUnitFromAvenger.uc:201-203 : Units spawned from the Avenger would sometimes not be able to take actions because their abilities weren't initialized properly. This is now fixed. #1035 - UICovertActions.uc:466-467 : Use SlotContainer.Navigator.SelectedIndex instead of Navigator.SelectedIndex to allow controller users editing all soldiers' loadouts. #1035 - UICovertActions.uc:1027-1028 : Use SlotContainer.Navigator.SelectedIndex instead of Navigator.SelectedIndex to allow controller users editing all soldiers' loadouts. #1035 - UICovertActions.uc:1031-1032 : Use SlotContainer.Navigator.SelectedIndex instead of Navigator.SelectedIndex to allow controller users editing all soldiers' loadouts. #1065 - UIArmory_LoadoutItem.uc:64-65 : UIArmory_LoadoutItem now shows the correct stack counts for modified finite items. #1073 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:13923-13924 : Get the unit's own Soldier Class Template rather than using Ranger's for all classes. #1082 - X2TacticalGameRuleset.uc:3012-3013 : MarkPlotUsed() - commented out original call and moved it outside of the if() statement #1090 - X2Item_DLC_Day60Armors.uc:64-67 : Prevent log warnings and redscreens when Alien Hunters armor is equipped in the Shell, e.g. Character Pool. Alien Hunters armor uses OnEquippedFn delegates to alter soldier appearance when the player equips them for the first time. The \"is first time\" check is done using XComHQ, which doesn't exist in the Shell. #1096 - UIChosenInfo.uc:155-156 : Abilities related to Chosen strengths and weaknesses now have their description expanded. #1096 - UIChosenInfo.uc:175 : #1096 - UIChosenLevelUp.uc:59 : #1096 - UIChosenReveal.uc:55 : #1096 - UIChosenReveal.uc:69 : #1108 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:8621-8622 : If there is a cosmetic pawn associated with the unequipped item item, remove it. #1118 - UICharacterPool_ListPools.uc:486-487 : LoadCharacterPool() may alter PoolFileName in certain conditions. #1120 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:14423-14424 : Add the effect's status icon only if it's not empty. #1131 - X2Ability_ReaperAbilitySet.uc:834-842 : A Target Condition on an X2Effect cannot be used to decide whether environmental damage should apply or not, because environmental damage is not triggered against any specific target, so there's nothing to check the condition against. The bugfix moves the condition logic into X2Effect_HomingMineDamage. This effect's condition is removed and the effect itself is neutered. The effect is left on the ability template to maintain the number of effects the same. #1145 - XComGameState_AIReinforcementSpawner.uc:283-284 : Reinforcements will now spawn their cosmetic units properly. Units spawned without their cosmetic units will crash when trying to use abilities that use them. #1171 - XComGameState_HeadquartersProjectHealSoldier.uc:81-83 : Round the HealthPercent value to prevent it landing above MaxHealthPercent of one Wound Severity, but below MinHealthPercent of the next one, making the code fail to select a Wound Severity at all. #1181 - UIFacilityGrid_FacilityOverlay.uc:1354-1355 : Make facility staff icons correctly display which staff slots are filled. #1182 - X2StrategyElement_XpackChosenActions.uc:326-327 : Make Defense Matrix properly reduce the chance of Chosen sabotage. #1190 - XComGameState_HeadquartersXCom.uc:4323-4326 : Fixes an issue where loot caches / hack rewards were ignoring the quantity of caches obtained (resulting in only a single cache reward of each type being awarded at the end of a mission, regardless of how many were obtained). Also fixes the issue where resources obtained from different cache types (e.g. Large + small intel) were not stacking in the post mission UI. #1192 - UIPawnMgr.uc:647-648 : Add call to StopSounds to remove sound effects for destroyed pawns. #1193 - XGAIPlayer.uc:939-941 : Added IsUnconcious and IsBleedingOut check to skip AI units in group who are Unconcious or Bleeding out as the AI processing hangs here until it times out, which causes the rest of the group to be skipped. #1195 - X2Ability_DefaultAbilitySet.uc:775-776 : Allow Return Fire shots to respond to enemy attacks if the enemy is in cover that requires a step out. #1196 - X2Ability_DefaultAbilitySet.uc:852-853 : Make Return Fire visualize after Covering Fire Overwatch, so they no longer fight for visualization. #1200 - X2AbilityToHitCalc.uc:126-127 : Make Dodge apply to Hit and Crit equally to fix Dodge increasing Miss chance. #1223 - X2Ability_CarryUnit.uc:304-305 : Added a skip exclusion for burning status so units can set down other carried units when they are on fire #1233 - UITacticalHUD_Enemies.uc:365-366 : Cache hit chances of visible targets to prevent multiple expensive GetHitChance() calls for each target. #1262 - X2Item_HeavyWeapons.uc:354-355 : Remove build time from the Shredstorm Cannon. #1274 - X2Action_ApplyWeaponDamageToUnit.uc:161-167 : Adjusted base-game logic for display of standard Red (Normal Damage), or Purple (Psionic) flyovers when damage is inflicted on a unit. Base game code first takes damage type from the weapon template, then if nothing is found, checks for DOTs / environmental damage. Issue #326 resolves flyovers for psionic effects not bound to weapons but modded abilities may wish to display the psionic flyover even when bound. The adjusted code changes the logic so the damagetype for flyovers is taken from the originating effect first, falls back to the weapon's base damage type and then uses default if nothing is found. #1276 - X2Ability_Chosen.uc:1770-1771 : Limit Chosen Low Profile to one trigger per turn. #1276 - X2Ability_Chosen.uc:1811-1813 : Comment out the effect that removes the Covering Fire effect responsible for triggering the Chosen Low Profile defense bonus ability, so it can trigger more than once per mission. #1281 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:671-672 : If the effect ignores all armor, max out the Pierce value in the Damage Preview so it will show up on the unit flag damage preview. #1286 - X2StatusEffects.uc:2490-2491 : Keep lure effect alive when source dies, tick on turn begin. Adjust icon and displayinfo to display as debuff rather than passive. #1288 - XComGameState_Effect.uc:1548-1551 : Fixes a bug in which a unit's cover may not be not correctly updated by the visibility manager when destructible actors are created directly adjacent to them (e.g. Pillar). The fix uses an eventlistener deferred to the end of the visualization block to clear and refresh the visibility manager. Resetting it in this way is a bit of a sledgehammer but since much of the cover/visibility system is native, limited viable alternatives exist. #1290 - XGUnit.uc:3245-3246 : Update XGUnit::DropWeapon() function with code from Chimera Squad to prevent unit weapons from glitching when dropped on death. #1293 - X2Ability_SkirmisherAbilitySet.uc:412-413 : Allow Justice to target enemies Mind Controlled by XCOM #1293 - X2Ability_SkirmisherAbilitySet.uc:687-688 : Allow Wrath to target enemies Mind Controlled by XCOM #1293 - X2Ability_SkirmisherAbilitySet.uc:815-816 : Allow Whiplash to target enemies Mind Controlled by XCOM #1293 - X2Ability_SkirmisherAbilitySet.uc:843-844 : Make enemies Mind Controlled by XCOM eligible for Whiplash's bonus damage #1298 - X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim.uc:377-378 : Add 100 crit chance to guaranteed crit abilities for the purposes of UI. #1299 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:153-154 : Apply rupture after dealing the damage from the attack. #1299 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:970-971 : Remove the cap from the amount of bonus damage that can be added to an attack by rupture, and do not add rupture added by this attack to the attack's damage. #1300 - X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim.uc:191-192 : Code block moved to be right after aim assist logic, so that if a miss is converted to a hit by aim assist, the ability will still crit if it is set up to always crit on hit. #1301 - XComIdleAnimationStateMachine.uc:934-935 : Targeting enemies from concealment will no longer make them face the unit doing the targeting. #1311 - X2Ability_SpecialistAbilitySet.uc:521-522 : Make Combat Protocol deal bonus damage to robots hacked by XCOM #1312 - X2Ability_StunLancer.uc:55-56 : Allow Stun Lance to target Mind Controlled units (currently on the same team as the Stun Lancer) #1318 - X2Condition_StasisLanceTarget.uc:27-28 : Disallow using Skulljack and Skullmine on units in Stasis. #1319 - X2TacticalGameRuleset.uc:1273-1279 : If mission start concealment is disabled by bForceNoSquadConcealment flag in BattleData, trigger the SquadConcealmentBroken event on mission start. In the base game, this flag is set only by the \"High Alert\" Dark Event. Triggering the event fixes the bug on Supply Extraction missions, where ADVENT never starts collecting supply crates if XCOM starts unconcealed, because the mission kismet starts the crate collection when the SquadConcealmentBroken event is triggered. #1320 - X2Action_ApplyWeaponDamageToUnit.uc:912-913 : Allow hit results other than eHit_Success to display flyovers. #1322 - X2Item_XpackWeapons.uc:495-496 : Comment out the line setting iTypicalActionCost for the conventional Vektor Rifle to match magnetic and beam variants. #1329 - X2Ability.uc:553-554 : Apply bonus weapon effects and ammo effects to multi targets. #1329 - X2Ability.uc:1234-1235 : Visualize bonus weapon effects and ammo effects being applied to multi targets. #1329 - X2Ability_GrenadierAbilitySet.uc:782-783 : Make Saturation Fire apply ammo effects and bonus weapon effects. #1329 - X2Ability_SharpshooterAbilitySet.uc:1182-1183 : Visualize applying bonus weapon effects and ammo effects to the primary target. #1329 - X2Ability_SharpshooterAbilitySet.uc:1286-1287 : Make Faceoff visualize applying bonus weapon effects and ammo effects to multi targets. #1332 - X2Ability_DefaultBondmateAbilities.uc:590-591 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_DefaultBondmateAbilities.uc:666-667 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_GrenadierAbilitySet.uc:640-641 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_GrenadierAbilitySet.uc:788-789 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_RangerAbilitySet.uc:760-761 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_RangerAbilitySet.uc:823-824 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_ReaperAbilitySet.uc:1172-1173 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_ReaperAbilitySet.uc:1239-1240 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_SharpshooterAbilitySet.uc:986-987 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1334 - X2Ability_ReaperAbilitySet.uc:1103-1104 : Use Weapon Typical Action Cost for Banish. #1334 - X2Ability_ReaperAbilitySet.uc:1275-1276 : Use Weapon Typical Action Cost for Sting. #1347 - UIUtilities_Strategy.uc:1940-1941 : Make GetMinimumContactCost() return zero when there are no more uncontacted regions to prevent Low Intel warnings. #1348 - UIArmory_MainMenu.uc:180-181 : Display the \"needs attention\" icon on the PCS button only if the soldier has an empty PCS slot. #1349 - X2Effect_PersistentVoidConduit.uc:62-66 : Fixes a bug in which the incorrect number of action points are removed from units under the effect of Void Conduit. This fix ensures that persistent effect remains on the unit during the tick instead of removing it. Furthermore, the on-tick visualization in X2Effect_VoidConduit was also found to be broken and hangs the visualiser so that is fixed as well. #1352 - XComGameState_HeadquartersXCom.uc:4160-4162 : Fixes a bug that caused PCS items which did not have exactly one stat boost, to not stack properly in the UI by making HasUnModifiedItem() properly compare items with multiple stat boosts or no stat boosts at all. #1353 - X2Ability_PsiOperativeAbilitySet.uc:306-307 : Fix issue with solace passive aura not applying to psi-operatives when more than one unit with the ability is present on the mission #1356 - XComHQPresentationLayer.uc:1515-1516 : ShowPromotionUI now casts the spawned promotion screen to UIArmory_Promotion instead of its subclasses #1372 - UIPhotoboothBase.uc:1378-1379 : Fixes a potential crash when the Photobooth shows many list items. #1380 - XComGameState_Effect.uc:272-276 : Fix bug where burst fire abilities with stacking effects were applying the wrong number of effect stacks to the target. This fix comments out base-game 'special handling' for burst-fire abilities - since each shot in the burst is handled independently, the stacking effects are already incremented in the onRefresh function so it is not necessary to additionally adjust them by the number of extra burst-fire shots when the ability is initiated. #1389 - X2Effect_Brutal.uc:14-15 : Make X2Effect_Brutal use unit's current Will instead of base Will so it can properly reduce and display it. #1391 - X2Ability_DLC_Day60ItemGrantedAbilitySet.uc:1121-1122 : Make Icarus Jump ability not offensive. #1391 - X2Ability_ChosenWarlock.uc:755-756 : Make Chosen Warlock's teleport ally ability not offensive. #1391 - X2Ability_Cyberus.uc:123-124 : Make Codex' teleport ability not offensive. #1391 - X2Ability_Cyberus.uc:381-382 : Make Codex' clone teleport ability not offensive. #1391 - X2Ability_Cyberus.uc:1257-1258 : Make MP Codex' teleport ability not offensive. #1391 - X2Ability_PsiWitch.uc:805-806 : Make Avatar's teleport-on-damage ability not offensive. #1393 - UIShellDifficulty.uc:1079-1083 : If skipping Intro movies, play the 'floating logo' movie instead of the standard intros. If nothing else plays here when starting a normal campaign, there is a high high chance of a hang on the loading screen. All of the downstream code is native so why this is required is not clear, but presumably some native code is expecting to find the end of a movie before initializing the start of the campaign / skyranger. #1394 - XComGameState_Ability.uc:1235-1240 : Abilities which do not specify a custom damage preview function will show rupture damage on the damage preview, even if the ability is not capable of doing any damage (e.g. self target abilities like reload). Checking that the previewed damage is non-zero before adding rupture damage to it mitigates this and improves the display (mainly for modded gameplay, but it also occurs in niche base game circumstances e.g. if a ruptured unit becomes mind controlled). #1395 - X2Helpers_DLC_Day60.uc:911-912 : Guard-rail to prevent vipers being able to target units grabbed by the archon king #1396 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:954-956 : Ensure that Damage-over-time effects applied by abilities that grazed or critted the target do not get their damage adjusted by checking for ApplyOnTick behavior #1398 - XGUnit.uc:1913-1917 : This fix adds additional checks to X2Action_ApplyWeaponDamageToUnit, to prevent 'Taking Damage' or 'Critically Wounded' voicelines from playing alongside the 'Death Scream' voiceline if a unit is killed. Additionally, it adds a delay to the 'Squad Member Dead' voicelines to reduce overlapy with deathscream voicelines that may already be playing. #1404 - X2Effect_Sustain.uc:50-51 : Update unit's lowest HP value when sustain activates since it wasn't being set properly before. #1408 - X2TargetingMethod_ArcWave.uc:124-125 : Fixes a bug with Arc Wave targeting where an ability could hit enemies not targeted by the player #1414 - X2Ability_SpecialistAbilitySet.uc:763-767 : Fixes the specialist's Revival Protocol and Restoration abilities to make them function as intended. Revival Protocol now can target any allied unit, not just units under player's control. Revival Protocol and Restoration now properly remove Stun, and no longer recover action points for Disoriented units. Revival Protocol now properly gets more Charges with higher GREMLIN tiers. #1417 - CHHelpers.uc:1157-1160 : This helper function uses a more robust check to ensure the geoscape is ready for alerts. This replaces functions that only check for the presence of a UIAlert screen, which can result in popups in places such as Squad Select or the Black Market screen if the campaign date lines up with flight time. #1419 - XGUnit.uc:1477-1478 : Characters that use WWise to play voicelines no longer attempt to play missing voicelines #1420 - XComTacticalInput.uc:3133-3134 : Abilities using X2TargetingMethod_ArcWave will now validate its additional targets when making a right-click pathing attack #1429 - XComGameState_Item.uc:796-800 : Fix bug that caused weapons that have weapon upgrades installed, despite not having any weapon upgrade slots, to stack in the HQ inventory, causing them to lose their installed upgrades when equipped. The fix removes the check for the number of weapon upgrade slots on the weapon from the logic that determines whether the item has been modified or not, and leaves just the check for number of installed weapon upgrades. #1431 - X2Effect_Knockback.uc:196-197 : Knockback actor trace is now a line trace: tracing with extents often resulted to units getting stuck on map geometry, moving no tiles #1431 - X2Effect_Knockback.uc:239-240 : Units knocked back may fly over units and land on them if they are high enough to take fall damage #1431 - X2Effect_Knockback.uc:358-359 : Units knocked back can now take fall damage falling from heights #1435 - X2Ability_SpecialistAbilitySet.uc:752-758 : Fix bug that allows Revival Protocol to remove effects that are normally removed by a Medikit heal, despite this functionality not being mentioned in the in-game localization, and units with these effects not being valid targets for this ability, unless they are also mentally impaired. The bug was caused by Firaxis reusing the RemoveAdditionalEffectsForRevivalProtocolAndRestorativeMist() function, which makes sense for Restoration, as that ability also applies Medikit heal, but not for Revival Protocol, which is only supposed to remove mental impairments. #1436 - X2Ability_SpecialistAbilitySet.uc:1242-1246 : Targeting conditions for the Restoration ability do not allow the ability to target units which have mental status effects but are not otherwise injured (or affected by an effect which can be removed by a medikit). This fix re-works the targeting conditions so that such units can be properly targeted. #1443 - X2HackReward.uc:301-303 : Fixes a bug where temporary hacking stat modifiers were being erroneously added to the Enemy Protocol hack reward bonus. Function adjusted to use GetBaseStat instead of GetMaxStat. #1457 - XComGameStateContext_HeadquartersOrder.uc:357-360 : This helper function forcibly removes disposed (dismissed / captured & ignored) soldiers from the AllSoldierBonds arrays of the remaining soldiers. This prevents redscreens from occurring when creating bonds after units have been dismissed or otherwise removed from the game. #1459 - XComGameState_Ability.uc:1485-1486 : Unit carrying another unit now properly updates the location of the carried unit instead of reduntantly updating its own location again #1461 - XComUnitPawn.uc:1102-1103 : Animations that use a powered ragdoll work again after unit had been previously ragdolled #1466 - XComGameState_HeadquartersXCom.uc:7546-7551 : Do not cache mission data in GetGeneratedMissionData(). Doing so bloats the save file and causes problems for mods like LWOTC and CI, which need hacks to clear stale data from the cache. The cache is still used temporarily during the post-mission sequence, because the XCGS_MissionSite is deleted too early. #1492 - XComGameState_HeadquartersXCom.uc:9121-9127 : This fix makes two key changes - 1. Adds new functions to XComGameStateHeadquarters_XCom which add individual template names to the 'first sighted aliens' array instead of their character groups. This is done to allow different narrative moments to play on units within the same character group. 2. New functions CanPlayAmbientNarrativeMoment and UpdateAmbientNarrativeMoment store each of the 'first sighted' narrative moments in the existing AmbientNarrativeMoments array, allowing us to check whether or not these VOs have been played already. This is used to prevent units with different template names replaying narrative VO each time a unit with a new template is spotted. #1498 - UITacticalHUD_MouseControls.uc:127-128 : Fix a crash when assigning commander abilities to invalid hotkeys #1501 - XGUnit.uc:1919-1921 : Check that the unit that died is a soldier and that if it is mind controlled, that it is not on our team (i.e. we want to play squadmate dead lines for mind controlled XCom units that die while on the other team's side) #1508 - XGUnit.uc:1059-1060 : XGUnit.UnitSpeak can now allow alien pawns that are used for XCOM soldiers to use voicepacks and speak. #1515 - X2Ability_DarkEvents.uc:406-409 : Adjust the 'counter-attack' dark event ability so that it is correctly applied to the primary weapon of the firing unit, and instead of granting a standard action point, it now grants a custom action point that can only be used for the dark event ability. #1543 - XComPresentationLayer.uc:216-217 : Enemies mind-controlled by XCOM show their action points on their unit flag now #1545 - XComInteractiveLevelActor.uc:729-730 : Closing a door that was opened by non-interact action like walking blocks visibility properly now #1547 - X2Ability.uc:183-184 : Use the environment damage value of the weapon with projectile events instead of a flat value, that resulted in low damage weapons destroying walls #1550 - XGAIBehavior.uc:9677-9678 : Patrolling or scampering units should be able to path through other members of their group now","title":"Bugfixes"},{"location":"Bugfixes/#bugfixes","text":"This page accomodates all bug fixes that do not deserve their own documentation page, as they are simple enough to be entirely explained by a single line. #20 - X2Ability.uc:1585-1586 : Reaper's Banish now properly visualizes subsequent shots. #33 - XGUnitNativeBase.uc:543-544 : Gremlins owned by AI units now correctly use fast walk animations even if their owner is in Red Alert #36 - X2TacticalGameRuleset.uc:4851-4852 : Do not clear Reinforcements' \"Summoning Sickness\" when interrupted by Skirmisher, denying them an erronous bonus turn. #39 - UIArmory_WeaponUpgrade.uc:558-559 : Create weapon pawn before setting PawnLocationTag so that the weapon can rotate when previewing weapon upgrades. #42 - X2Action_ApplyWeaponDamageToUnit.uc:1286-1287 : Prevent X2Action_ApplyWeaponDamageToUnit from resetting unit's weapons to default sockets if the unit is interrupted. #51 - XComGameState_AdventChosen.uc:264-265 : Prevent Assassin from gaining perks incompatible with forced \"Shadowstep\" in Lost and Abandoned #55 - CHItemSlot.uc:349-350 : Check a soldier's NeedsSecondaryWeapon everywhere instead of hardcoding based on Rookie rank #70 - CharacterPoolManager.uc:449-450 : CharacterPoolManager:CreateCharacter now honors ForceCountry #95 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:13902-13903 : ResetRankToRookie now correctly applies Beta Strike HP bonuses #160 - UIOptionsPCScreen.uc:3148-3149 : UIOptionsPCScreen now shows all part pack sliders, adding a scroll bar if needed #215 - XGUnit.uc:1537-1538 : Units are now allowed to have personality speech (affected by personality) even below \"Veteran\" rank #269 - XComIdleAnimationStateMachine.uc:1101-1102 : Fix some edge cases in XComIdleAnimationStateMachine regarding idle animations, targeting, and step-outs #273 - X2Ability.uc:1639-1640 : Fix an issue causing Rapid Fire/Chain Shot/Banish/... entering cover early #303 - UITooltipInfoList.uc:98-99 : UITooltipInfoList no longer displays stale data like weapon upgrades from other units #318 - X2Camera_Cinescript.uc:528-529 : Fix Cinescript CutAfterPrevious not working in combination with MatineeReplacements , breaking Spark BIT hack camera #326 - X2Action_ApplyWeaponDamageToUnit.uc:205-207 : Allow damage flyovers from weapon-less Psi abilities to use the Psi damage popup (e.g. Effect Damage from X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage, PsiBombStage2 & modded abilities) #346 - X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim.uc:387-388 : Prevent X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim from applying BuiltInHitMod and BuiltInCritMod against non-units. #350 - XComCharacterCustomization.uc:546-548 : Updates various classes (XComCharacterCustomization, XCGS_Unit, XComHumanPawn and XGCharacterGenerator) to carry out proper validation and selection of valid body parts on soldiers when other parts are changed in the armory. #367 - XComGameState_Item.uc:486-487 : Gremlins now correctly die when the Gremlin's owner dies while the Gremlin is attached to another unit. #376 - XGUnit.uc:3785-3786 : Gremlins (and other Cosmetic Units) are now correctly tinted and patterned #379 - XComGameState_HuntersLodgeManager.uc:181-183 : Check if the Chosen is defeated to determine whether the Hunter's Lodge should display their trophy, rather than checking if XCOM has researched their weapons. #380 - XComCharacterCustomization.uc:825-826 : Update cosmetic pawns when secondary armor color is changed as well as primary #380 - XComUnitPawn.uc:2361-2362 : Ensure that the appearence of cosmetic unit pawns is updated properly, even when a new pawn is not created #384 - XComHumanPawn.uc:2370-2371 : Remove cosmetics from separate Left and Right Arm slots when updating Appearance to one that includes a cosmetic body part for both Arms in one slot. #384 - XComHumanPawn.uc:2437-2438 : Allow bForcedAppearance to work with new deco slots added with Anarchy Children and WOTC. #384 - XGCharacterGenerator.uc:714-715 : Randomize deco slots only if the character template is not using bForceAppearance . #426 - X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim.uc:201-202 : Fix X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim discarding unfavorable (for XCOM) changes to hit results from effects #493 - X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim.uc:762-763 : Allow REACTION_DASHING_FINALMOD to reduce reaction fire hit chance against dashing targets #496 - X2Ability_Chosen.uc:1569-1570 : Fix the timeout during Chosen death teleport visualization by refactoring ChosenDefeatedEscape_BuildVisualization. #503 - XGAIBehavior.uc:9749-9750 : \"Flying\" pod leaders now patrol despite non-flat tiles on their paths #508 - XComGameState_AIGroup.uc:422-423 : Patrol logic now ensures units do not attempt to patrol outside of the map which would cause them to stop patrolling #520 - X2MeleePathingPawn.uc:186-187 : Controller input now allows choosing melee attack destination tile despite floor differences #531 - X2Ability_ChosenAssassin.uc:565-566 : Assassin gains a temporary instead of permanently stacking mobility boost from performing a melee attack #551 - X2Action_SwapTeams.uc:48-49 : Rescue rings no longer disappear on other rescuable units after a neutral unit swaps to team XCom #557 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:2434-2435 : Soldiers that have been carried out of a mission are no longer unable to be carried out of a later mission #608 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:4463-4464 : MergeAmmoAsNeeded now also works for units spawned from the Avenger #609 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:8239-8240 : Apply weapon customization from soldier appearance when equipping weapons. #613 - UIX2PanelHeader.uc:53-54 : SetText now sends text to flash instead of requiring calling SetHeaderWidth #617 - X2TargetingMethod_RocketLauncher.uc:44-45 : Ray trace from the peek tile to the target, not from the unit tile to the peek tile. #637 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:14801-14802 : Will recovery project and soldier mental state are now consistent with each other, fixing Shaken/Tired soldiers occasionally recovering instantly #638 - UIScanButton.uc:278-279 : UIScanButton can now work properly when it's a grandchild of UIStrategyMapItem, not only when direct child #644 - X2Ability_DefaultAbilitySet.uc:426-427 : Allow patrolling units to occupy the same tile instead of teleporting to (0,0,0) when out of space, potentially revealing XCOM #648 - UIHackingScreen.uc:410-411 : Cancelling a hack in progress using Esc no longer bypasses Haywire's cooldown #682 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:6979-6981 : Zombies will no longer drop loot. Only affects mods that destroy loot when killing units with explosives. #701 - UIArmory_LoadoutItem.uc:78-79 : Allows armory UI to highlight the item the player needs to build during the tutorial even if it's not the item with the exact template name 'Medikit' #775 - XGBase.uc:263-264 : Applying facility upgrades before the facility map is loaded no longer crashes the game. #817 - UIOptionsPCScreen.uc:1544-1545 : Disable the Framerate Smoothing option, as it's known to break Mod Class Overrides. #824 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:2581-2583 : Units that are still stunned when a mission ends no longer lose action points at the start of their next mission. #861 - UIStaffSlot.uc:223-227 : By default, UIStaffSlot removes highlighting when a personnel is selected. However, the slot still has navigator focus, and should remain highlighted. This only affects controllers since the mouse has moved off the button at this point. If a controller is active, don't let the game un-highlight it. #862 - UIStaffSlot.uc:405-408 : By default, UIStaffSlot will blink on and off a staff slot that \"loses\" focus when focus doesn't belong to it in the first place. Make sure to only change focus if the element is not already in the destination focus state #866 - UIStaffContainer.uc:58-60 : By default, UIStaffContainer tries to shortcut which UIPanel should receive focus, but the shortcut is often wrong and the time it saves is negligible, so this bypasses it. #879 - X2Ability.uc:883-884 : Use HistoryIndex to access the AbilityState as it was when the ability was activated rather than getting the most recent version. #879 - X2Ability.uc:902-903 : Use HistoryIndex to access the WeaponState as it was when the ability was activated rather than getting the most recent version. #880 - UIArmory_WeaponUpgrade.uc:750-751 : Remove unnecessary text coloring from the weapon pattern value text. #896 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:476-478 : Call the (hopefully) relevant delegate, if this weapon upgrade has it. This makes the guaranteed damage on missed shots added by Stocks properly benefit from Insider Knowledge #896 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:855-857 : Call the (hopefully) relevant delegate, if this weapon upgrade has it. This makes the guaranteed damage on missed shots added by Stocks properly benefit from Insider Knowledge #896 - X2Effect_LaserSight.uc:28-29 : Add bonus crit if Insider Knowledge is present. #924 - UIChoosePsiAbility.uc:211-212 : Prevent the psi ability training screen from showing duplicate abilities #927 - XComGameState_GeoscapeEntity.uc:311-314 : When cancelling out of squad select or mission launch, the selected map item will now return back to the mission rather than the Avenger (affects controller users). #952 - UIChosenInfo.uc:56-57 : Focus the top Chosen button when the screen is opened. #952 - UIChosenInfo.uc:431-432 : Fix typo in the MC function call. #990 - X2Ability_HackRewards.uc:736-738 : Trigger the hack reward ability only if it's present in the Game State. This prevents hack rewards from being granted multiple times. #1008 - XGAIBehavior.uc:10084-10086 : Entire pods no longer fail to scamper if the pod leader skips its turn, for example if it's immobilized. #1029 - SeqAct_SpawnUnitFromAvenger.uc:201-203 : Units spawned from the Avenger would sometimes not be able to take actions because their abilities weren't initialized properly. This is now fixed. #1035 - UICovertActions.uc:466-467 : Use SlotContainer.Navigator.SelectedIndex instead of Navigator.SelectedIndex to allow controller users editing all soldiers' loadouts. #1035 - UICovertActions.uc:1027-1028 : Use SlotContainer.Navigator.SelectedIndex instead of Navigator.SelectedIndex to allow controller users editing all soldiers' loadouts. #1035 - UICovertActions.uc:1031-1032 : Use SlotContainer.Navigator.SelectedIndex instead of Navigator.SelectedIndex to allow controller users editing all soldiers' loadouts. #1065 - UIArmory_LoadoutItem.uc:64-65 : UIArmory_LoadoutItem now shows the correct stack counts for modified finite items. #1073 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:13923-13924 : Get the unit's own Soldier Class Template rather than using Ranger's for all classes. #1082 - X2TacticalGameRuleset.uc:3012-3013 : MarkPlotUsed() - commented out original call and moved it outside of the if() statement #1090 - X2Item_DLC_Day60Armors.uc:64-67 : Prevent log warnings and redscreens when Alien Hunters armor is equipped in the Shell, e.g. Character Pool. Alien Hunters armor uses OnEquippedFn delegates to alter soldier appearance when the player equips them for the first time. The \"is first time\" check is done using XComHQ, which doesn't exist in the Shell. #1096 - UIChosenInfo.uc:155-156 : Abilities related to Chosen strengths and weaknesses now have their description expanded. #1096 - UIChosenInfo.uc:175 : #1096 - UIChosenLevelUp.uc:59 : #1096 - UIChosenReveal.uc:55 : #1096 - UIChosenReveal.uc:69 : #1108 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:8621-8622 : If there is a cosmetic pawn associated with the unequipped item item, remove it. #1118 - UICharacterPool_ListPools.uc:486-487 : LoadCharacterPool() may alter PoolFileName in certain conditions. #1120 - XComGameState_Unit.uc:14423-14424 : Add the effect's status icon only if it's not empty. #1131 - X2Ability_ReaperAbilitySet.uc:834-842 : A Target Condition on an X2Effect cannot be used to decide whether environmental damage should apply or not, because environmental damage is not triggered against any specific target, so there's nothing to check the condition against. The bugfix moves the condition logic into X2Effect_HomingMineDamage. This effect's condition is removed and the effect itself is neutered. The effect is left on the ability template to maintain the number of effects the same. #1145 - XComGameState_AIReinforcementSpawner.uc:283-284 : Reinforcements will now spawn their cosmetic units properly. Units spawned without their cosmetic units will crash when trying to use abilities that use them. #1171 - XComGameState_HeadquartersProjectHealSoldier.uc:81-83 : Round the HealthPercent value to prevent it landing above MaxHealthPercent of one Wound Severity, but below MinHealthPercent of the next one, making the code fail to select a Wound Severity at all. #1181 - UIFacilityGrid_FacilityOverlay.uc:1354-1355 : Make facility staff icons correctly display which staff slots are filled. #1182 - X2StrategyElement_XpackChosenActions.uc:326-327 : Make Defense Matrix properly reduce the chance of Chosen sabotage. #1190 - XComGameState_HeadquartersXCom.uc:4323-4326 : Fixes an issue where loot caches / hack rewards were ignoring the quantity of caches obtained (resulting in only a single cache reward of each type being awarded at the end of a mission, regardless of how many were obtained). Also fixes the issue where resources obtained from different cache types (e.g. Large + small intel) were not stacking in the post mission UI. #1192 - UIPawnMgr.uc:647-648 : Add call to StopSounds to remove sound effects for destroyed pawns. #1193 - XGAIPlayer.uc:939-941 : Added IsUnconcious and IsBleedingOut check to skip AI units in group who are Unconcious or Bleeding out as the AI processing hangs here until it times out, which causes the rest of the group to be skipped. #1195 - X2Ability_DefaultAbilitySet.uc:775-776 : Allow Return Fire shots to respond to enemy attacks if the enemy is in cover that requires a step out. #1196 - X2Ability_DefaultAbilitySet.uc:852-853 : Make Return Fire visualize after Covering Fire Overwatch, so they no longer fight for visualization. #1200 - X2AbilityToHitCalc.uc:126-127 : Make Dodge apply to Hit and Crit equally to fix Dodge increasing Miss chance. #1223 - X2Ability_CarryUnit.uc:304-305 : Added a skip exclusion for burning status so units can set down other carried units when they are on fire #1233 - UITacticalHUD_Enemies.uc:365-366 : Cache hit chances of visible targets to prevent multiple expensive GetHitChance() calls for each target. #1262 - X2Item_HeavyWeapons.uc:354-355 : Remove build time from the Shredstorm Cannon. #1274 - X2Action_ApplyWeaponDamageToUnit.uc:161-167 : Adjusted base-game logic for display of standard Red (Normal Damage), or Purple (Psionic) flyovers when damage is inflicted on a unit. Base game code first takes damage type from the weapon template, then if nothing is found, checks for DOTs / environmental damage. Issue #326 resolves flyovers for psionic effects not bound to weapons but modded abilities may wish to display the psionic flyover even when bound. The adjusted code changes the logic so the damagetype for flyovers is taken from the originating effect first, falls back to the weapon's base damage type and then uses default if nothing is found. #1276 - X2Ability_Chosen.uc:1770-1771 : Limit Chosen Low Profile to one trigger per turn. #1276 - X2Ability_Chosen.uc:1811-1813 : Comment out the effect that removes the Covering Fire effect responsible for triggering the Chosen Low Profile defense bonus ability, so it can trigger more than once per mission. #1281 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:671-672 : If the effect ignores all armor, max out the Pierce value in the Damage Preview so it will show up on the unit flag damage preview. #1286 - X2StatusEffects.uc:2490-2491 : Keep lure effect alive when source dies, tick on turn begin. Adjust icon and displayinfo to display as debuff rather than passive. #1288 - XComGameState_Effect.uc:1548-1551 : Fixes a bug in which a unit's cover may not be not correctly updated by the visibility manager when destructible actors are created directly adjacent to them (e.g. Pillar). The fix uses an eventlistener deferred to the end of the visualization block to clear and refresh the visibility manager. Resetting it in this way is a bit of a sledgehammer but since much of the cover/visibility system is native, limited viable alternatives exist. #1290 - XGUnit.uc:3245-3246 : Update XGUnit::DropWeapon() function with code from Chimera Squad to prevent unit weapons from glitching when dropped on death. #1293 - X2Ability_SkirmisherAbilitySet.uc:412-413 : Allow Justice to target enemies Mind Controlled by XCOM #1293 - X2Ability_SkirmisherAbilitySet.uc:687-688 : Allow Wrath to target enemies Mind Controlled by XCOM #1293 - X2Ability_SkirmisherAbilitySet.uc:815-816 : Allow Whiplash to target enemies Mind Controlled by XCOM #1293 - X2Ability_SkirmisherAbilitySet.uc:843-844 : Make enemies Mind Controlled by XCOM eligible for Whiplash's bonus damage #1298 - X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim.uc:377-378 : Add 100 crit chance to guaranteed crit abilities for the purposes of UI. #1299 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:153-154 : Apply rupture after dealing the damage from the attack. #1299 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:970-971 : Remove the cap from the amount of bonus damage that can be added to an attack by rupture, and do not add rupture added by this attack to the attack's damage. #1300 - X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim.uc:191-192 : Code block moved to be right after aim assist logic, so that if a miss is converted to a hit by aim assist, the ability will still crit if it is set up to always crit on hit. #1301 - XComIdleAnimationStateMachine.uc:934-935 : Targeting enemies from concealment will no longer make them face the unit doing the targeting. #1311 - X2Ability_SpecialistAbilitySet.uc:521-522 : Make Combat Protocol deal bonus damage to robots hacked by XCOM #1312 - X2Ability_StunLancer.uc:55-56 : Allow Stun Lance to target Mind Controlled units (currently on the same team as the Stun Lancer) #1318 - X2Condition_StasisLanceTarget.uc:27-28 : Disallow using Skulljack and Skullmine on units in Stasis. #1319 - X2TacticalGameRuleset.uc:1273-1279 : If mission start concealment is disabled by bForceNoSquadConcealment flag in BattleData, trigger the SquadConcealmentBroken event on mission start. In the base game, this flag is set only by the \"High Alert\" Dark Event. Triggering the event fixes the bug on Supply Extraction missions, where ADVENT never starts collecting supply crates if XCOM starts unconcealed, because the mission kismet starts the crate collection when the SquadConcealmentBroken event is triggered. #1320 - X2Action_ApplyWeaponDamageToUnit.uc:912-913 : Allow hit results other than eHit_Success to display flyovers. #1322 - X2Item_XpackWeapons.uc:495-496 : Comment out the line setting iTypicalActionCost for the conventional Vektor Rifle to match magnetic and beam variants. #1329 - X2Ability.uc:553-554 : Apply bonus weapon effects and ammo effects to multi targets. #1329 - X2Ability.uc:1234-1235 : Visualize bonus weapon effects and ammo effects being applied to multi targets. #1329 - X2Ability_GrenadierAbilitySet.uc:782-783 : Make Saturation Fire apply ammo effects and bonus weapon effects. #1329 - X2Ability_SharpshooterAbilitySet.uc:1182-1183 : Visualize applying bonus weapon effects and ammo effects to the primary target. #1329 - X2Ability_SharpshooterAbilitySet.uc:1286-1287 : Make Faceoff visualize applying bonus weapon effects and ammo effects to multi targets. #1332 - X2Ability_DefaultBondmateAbilities.uc:590-591 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_DefaultBondmateAbilities.uc:666-667 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_GrenadierAbilitySet.uc:640-641 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_GrenadierAbilitySet.uc:788-789 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_RangerAbilitySet.uc:760-761 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_RangerAbilitySet.uc:823-824 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_ReaperAbilitySet.uc:1172-1173 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_ReaperAbilitySet.uc:1239-1240 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1332 - X2Ability_SharpshooterAbilitySet.uc:986-987 : Add the missing Stock damage effect. #1334 - X2Ability_ReaperAbilitySet.uc:1103-1104 : Use Weapon Typical Action Cost for Banish. #1334 - X2Ability_ReaperAbilitySet.uc:1275-1276 : Use Weapon Typical Action Cost for Sting. #1347 - UIUtilities_Strategy.uc:1940-1941 : Make GetMinimumContactCost() return zero when there are no more uncontacted regions to prevent Low Intel warnings. #1348 - UIArmory_MainMenu.uc:180-181 : Display the \"needs attention\" icon on the PCS button only if the soldier has an empty PCS slot. #1349 - X2Effect_PersistentVoidConduit.uc:62-66 : Fixes a bug in which the incorrect number of action points are removed from units under the effect of Void Conduit. This fix ensures that persistent effect remains on the unit during the tick instead of removing it. Furthermore, the on-tick visualization in X2Effect_VoidConduit was also found to be broken and hangs the visualiser so that is fixed as well. #1352 - XComGameState_HeadquartersXCom.uc:4160-4162 : Fixes a bug that caused PCS items which did not have exactly one stat boost, to not stack properly in the UI by making HasUnModifiedItem() properly compare items with multiple stat boosts or no stat boosts at all. #1353 - X2Ability_PsiOperativeAbilitySet.uc:306-307 : Fix issue with solace passive aura not applying to psi-operatives when more than one unit with the ability is present on the mission #1356 - XComHQPresentationLayer.uc:1515-1516 : ShowPromotionUI now casts the spawned promotion screen to UIArmory_Promotion instead of its subclasses #1372 - UIPhotoboothBase.uc:1378-1379 : Fixes a potential crash when the Photobooth shows many list items. #1380 - XComGameState_Effect.uc:272-276 : Fix bug where burst fire abilities with stacking effects were applying the wrong number of effect stacks to the target. This fix comments out base-game 'special handling' for burst-fire abilities - since each shot in the burst is handled independently, the stacking effects are already incremented in the onRefresh function so it is not necessary to additionally adjust them by the number of extra burst-fire shots when the ability is initiated. #1389 - X2Effect_Brutal.uc:14-15 : Make X2Effect_Brutal use unit's current Will instead of base Will so it can properly reduce and display it. #1391 - X2Ability_DLC_Day60ItemGrantedAbilitySet.uc:1121-1122 : Make Icarus Jump ability not offensive. #1391 - X2Ability_ChosenWarlock.uc:755-756 : Make Chosen Warlock's teleport ally ability not offensive. #1391 - X2Ability_Cyberus.uc:123-124 : Make Codex' teleport ability not offensive. #1391 - X2Ability_Cyberus.uc:381-382 : Make Codex' clone teleport ability not offensive. #1391 - X2Ability_Cyberus.uc:1257-1258 : Make MP Codex' teleport ability not offensive. #1391 - X2Ability_PsiWitch.uc:805-806 : Make Avatar's teleport-on-damage ability not offensive. #1393 - UIShellDifficulty.uc:1079-1083 : If skipping Intro movies, play the 'floating logo' movie instead of the standard intros. If nothing else plays here when starting a normal campaign, there is a high high chance of a hang on the loading screen. All of the downstream code is native so why this is required is not clear, but presumably some native code is expecting to find the end of a movie before initializing the start of the campaign / skyranger. #1394 - XComGameState_Ability.uc:1235-1240 : Abilities which do not specify a custom damage preview function will show rupture damage on the damage preview, even if the ability is not capable of doing any damage (e.g. self target abilities like reload). Checking that the previewed damage is non-zero before adding rupture damage to it mitigates this and improves the display (mainly for modded gameplay, but it also occurs in niche base game circumstances e.g. if a ruptured unit becomes mind controlled). #1395 - X2Helpers_DLC_Day60.uc:911-912 : Guard-rail to prevent vipers being able to target units grabbed by the archon king #1396 - X2Effect_ApplyWeaponDamage.uc:954-956 : Ensure that Damage-over-time effects applied by abilities that grazed or critted the target do not get their damage adjusted by checking for ApplyOnTick behavior #1398 - XGUnit.uc:1913-1917 : This fix adds additional checks to X2Action_ApplyWeaponDamageToUnit, to prevent 'Taking Damage' or 'Critically Wounded' voicelines from playing alongside the 'Death Scream' voiceline if a unit is killed. Additionally, it adds a delay to the 'Squad Member Dead' voicelines to reduce overlapy with deathscream voicelines that may already be playing. #1404 - X2Effect_Sustain.uc:50-51 : Update unit's lowest HP value when sustain activates since it wasn't being set properly before. #1408 - X2TargetingMethod_ArcWave.uc:124-125 : Fixes a bug with Arc Wave targeting where an ability could hit enemies not targeted by the player #1414 - X2Ability_SpecialistAbilitySet.uc:763-767 : Fixes the specialist's Revival Protocol and Restoration abilities to make them function as intended. Revival Protocol now can target any allied unit, not just units under player's control. Revival Protocol and Restoration now properly remove Stun, and no longer recover action points for Disoriented units. Revival Protocol now properly gets more Charges with higher GREMLIN tiers. #1417 - CHHelpers.uc:1157-1160 : This helper function uses a more robust check to ensure the geoscape is ready for alerts. This replaces functions that only check for the presence of a UIAlert screen, which can result in popups in places such as Squad Select or the Black Market screen if the campaign date lines up with flight time. #1419 - XGUnit.uc:1477-1478 : Characters that use WWise to play voicelines no longer attempt to play missing voicelines #1420 - XComTacticalInput.uc:3133-3134 : Abilities using X2TargetingMethod_ArcWave will now validate its additional targets when making a right-click pathing attack #1429 - XComGameState_Item.uc:796-800 : Fix bug that caused weapons that have weapon upgrades installed, despite not having any weapon upgrade slots, to stack in the HQ inventory, causing them to lose their installed upgrades when equipped. The fix removes the check for the number of weapon upgrade slots on the weapon from the logic that determines whether the item has been modified or not, and leaves just the check for number of installed weapon upgrades. #1431 - X2Effect_Knockback.uc:196-197 : Knockback actor trace is now a line trace: tracing with extents often resulted to units getting stuck on map geometry, moving no tiles #1431 - X2Effect_Knockback.uc:239-240 : Units knocked back may fly over units and land on them if they are high enough to take fall damage #1431 - X2Effect_Knockback.uc:358-359 : Units knocked back can now take fall damage falling from heights #1435 - X2Ability_SpecialistAbilitySet.uc:752-758 : Fix bug that allows Revival Protocol to remove effects that are normally removed by a Medikit heal, despite this functionality not being mentioned in the in-game localization, and units with these effects not being valid targets for this ability, unless they are also mentally impaired. The bug was caused by Firaxis reusing the RemoveAdditionalEffectsForRevivalProtocolAndRestorativeMist() function, which makes sense for Restoration, as that ability also applies Medikit heal, but not for Revival Protocol, which is only supposed to remove mental impairments. #1436 - X2Ability_SpecialistAbilitySet.uc:1242-1246 : Targeting conditions for the Restoration ability do not allow the ability to target units which have mental status effects but are not otherwise injured (or affected by an effect which can be removed by a medikit). This fix re-works the targeting conditions so that such units can be properly targeted. #1443 - X2HackReward.uc:301-303 : Fixes a bug where temporary hacking stat modifiers were being erroneously added to the Enemy Protocol hack reward bonus. Function adjusted to use GetBaseStat instead of GetMaxStat. #1457 - XComGameStateContext_HeadquartersOrder.uc:357-360 : This helper function forcibly removes disposed (dismissed / captured & ignored) soldiers from the AllSoldierBonds arrays of the remaining soldiers. This prevents redscreens from occurring when creating bonds after units have been dismissed or otherwise removed from the game. #1459 - XComGameState_Ability.uc:1485-1486 : Unit carrying another unit now properly updates the location of the carried unit instead of reduntantly updating its own location again #1461 - XComUnitPawn.uc:1102-1103 : Animations that use a powered ragdoll work again after unit had been previously ragdolled #1466 - XComGameState_HeadquartersXCom.uc:7546-7551 : Do not cache mission data in GetGeneratedMissionData(). Doing so bloats the save file and causes problems for mods like LWOTC and CI, which need hacks to clear stale data from the cache. The cache is still used temporarily during the post-mission sequence, because the XCGS_MissionSite is deleted too early. #1492 - XComGameState_HeadquartersXCom.uc:9121-9127 : This fix makes two key changes - 1. Adds new functions to XComGameStateHeadquarters_XCom which add individual template names to the 'first sighted aliens' array instead of their character groups. This is done to allow different narrative moments to play on units within the same character group. 2. New functions CanPlayAmbientNarrativeMoment and UpdateAmbientNarrativeMoment store each of the 'first sighted' narrative moments in the existing AmbientNarrativeMoments array, allowing us to check whether or not these VOs have been played already. This is used to prevent units with different template names replaying narrative VO each time a unit with a new template is spotted. #1498 - UITacticalHUD_MouseControls.uc:127-128 : Fix a crash when assigning commander abilities to invalid hotkeys #1501 - XGUnit.uc:1919-1921 : Check that the unit that died is a soldier and that if it is mind controlled, that it is not on our team (i.e. we want to play squadmate dead lines for mind controlled XCom units that die while on the other team's side) #1508 - XGUnit.uc:1059-1060 : XGUnit.UnitSpeak can now allow alien pawns that are used for XCOM soldiers to use voicepacks and speak. #1515 - X2Ability_DarkEvents.uc:406-409 : Adjust the 'counter-attack' dark event ability so that it is correctly applied to the primary weapon of the firing unit, and instead of granting a standard action point, it now grants a custom action point that can only be used for the dark event ability. #1543 - XComPresentationLayer.uc:216-217 : Enemies mind-controlled by XCOM show their action points on their unit flag now #1545 - XComInteractiveLevelActor.uc:729-730 : Closing a door that was opened by non-interact action like walking blocks visibility properly now #1547 - X2Ability.uc:183-184 : Use the environment damage value of the weapon with projectile events instead of a flat value, that resulted in low damage weapons destroying walls #1550 - XGAIBehavior.uc:9677-9678 : Patrolling or scampering units should be able to path through other members of their group now","title":"Bugfixes"},{"location":"compatibility/","text":"Compatibility Because the Highlander is a core mod that many different mods on the workshop depend on, it strives to not make any observable changes to the base game (save for bug fixes and features that mods explicitly make use of).

Mods can subscribe to any event by name, and then Read some of the data passed with the event Perform actions in response to the event Send data back to the sender of the event Especially the last option is something many Highlander hooks expect mods to do. This is done with the XComLWTuple class. It can contain arbitrary tagged data, can be read and written to by mods. Consider it a polymorphic tuple that is compatible with any event trigger/listener signature. HL Event documentation All Highlander-triggered events use a specification that looks like the following: OverridePromotionUIClass event Param Value EventID OverridePromotionUIClass EventData XComLWTuple EventSource XComHQPresentationLayer NewGameState none Tuple contents Index Name Type Direction 0 PromotionScreenType enum (CHLPromotionScreenType) in 1 PromotionUIClass class (class<UIArmory_Promotion>) inout Listener template static function EventListenerReturn OnOverridePromotionUIClass(Object EventData, Object EventSource, XComGameState GameState, Name EventID, Object CallbackObject) { local XComHQPresentationLayer Pres; local XComLWTuple Tuple; local CHLPromotionScreenType PromotionScreenType; local class<UIArmory_Promotion> PromotionUIClass; Pres = XComHQPresentationLayer(EventSource); Tuple = XComLWTuple(EventData); PromotionScreenType = CHLPromotionScreenType(Tuple.Data[0].i); PromotionUIClass = class<UIArmory_Promotion>(Tuple.Data[1].o); // Your code here Tuple.Data[1].o = PromotionUIClass; return ELR_NoInterrupt; } The \"$event_name event\" paragraph describes which values a listener receives. EventID is the event name, EventData and EventSource list the types of the objects passed along, and NewGameState describes whether there is a NewGameState provided in the TriggerEvent call. If the EventData is an XComLWTuple , the \"Tuple contents\" paragraph lists the type and name of every variable passed using the tuple, along with its direction: An in variable has a meaningful value when the event is triggered, and mods may read it, usually to inspect the default value the game has determined. If a variable is not in , it may not be initialized when read from. An out variable will be read from by the game after all event listeners have been executed, usually with the expectation that a mod may have changed it to control some behaviors of the game. If a variable is not out , assigning to it is a no-op. An inout variable has a meaningful default value and will be read from after the event listeners have been executed. Note that exchanging data through an XComLWTuple requires subscribing to the event with the ELD_Immediate deferral. The \"Listener template\" is a copy-pasteable function that you can copy into your own mod as a starting point for using the event. Note: It is highly recommended that you use the CHEventListenerTemplate to subscribe to such events, as it is robust against history changes and allows you to provide the ELD_Immediate deferral. For this event, you would subscribe like this: Template.RegisterInStrategy = true; Template.AddCHEvent('OverridePromotionUIClass', OnOverridePromotionUIClass, ELD_Immediate, 50); Event-relevant pages The following is a list of all pages tagged \"Events\" due to their relevance to or use of the event system. #4 - CHEventListenerTemplate #93 - OverrideNumUpgradeSlots #106 - DynamicSoldierClassDisplay #110 - OnGetPCSImage #172 - OverrideHasHeavyWeapon #257 - OverrideUnitFocusUI #289 - ItemUpgraded #365 - Geoscape_ResInfoButtonVisible #365 - UIStrategyPolicy_ShowCovertActionsOnClose #368 - UIAvengerShortcuts_ShowCQResistanceOrders #391 - GetCovertActionEvents_Settings #393 - OverrideClipSize #400 - OverrideAbilityIconColor #408 - DynamicSoldierRankDisplay #420 - UpdateNavHelp #438 - CovertAction_PreventGiveRewards #448 - OverrideDisableReinforcementsFlare #490 - DrawDebugLabels #500 - OverrideEncounterZoneAnchorPoint #507 - OverridePatrolBehavior #534 - PsiProjectCompleted #561 - SitRepCheckAdditionalRequirements #562 - OnDistributeTacticalGameEndXp #562 - OverrideKillXp #562 - OverrideTotalNumKills #564 - AllowInteractHack #600 - OverridePromotionBlueprintTagPrefix #600 - OverridePromotionUIClass #624 - OverrideRespecSoldierProjectPoints #631 - OverrideShowPromoteIcon #633 - CanTechBeInspired #635 - OverrideMissionImage #650 - WillRecoveryTimeModifier #663 - UIResistanceReport_ShowCouncil #666 - ShouldCivilianRun #667 - OverrideNextRetaliationDisplay #676 - OnBestGearLoadoutApplied #694 - ItemAddedOrRemovedToSlot #711 - OverrideDarkEventCount #718 - OverridePatrolDestination #735 - OverrideHasAmmoPocket #735 - OverrideHasExtraUtilitySlot #735 - OverrideHasGrenadePocket #749 - OverrideAbilityIconColorImproved #752 - AllowOnCovertActionCompleteAnalytics #753 - PreDarkEventDeactivated #754 - XComLWTuple #774 - OverrideAllowStartingRegionLink #785 - PreCompleteStrategyFromTacticalTransfer #791 - AllowRulerOnMission #800 - PostInventoryLoadoutApplied #801 - FirstPromotionOverrideClass #807 - CovertAction_OverrideCostScalar #807 - CovertAction_OverrideRewardScalar #814 - ValidateGTSClassTraining #815 - OverrideEligibleTrainingCenterAbilities #825 - OverrideHitEffects #829 - OverrideProjectileInstance #837 - KismetGameStateMatinee #842 - OverrideHasInfiniteAmmo #844 - ShowItemInLockerList #864 - WorldRegionGetMeshScale #864 - WorldRegionGetStaticMesh #871 - HeadquartersUnitFired #875 - OverrideCanTakeFacilityMission #903 - OverrideDamageRemovesReserveActionPoints #921 - OverrideWeaponScale #932 - StrategyMap_NavHelpUpdated #986 - UIStrategyPolicy_MiscEvents #994 - AllowNoSquadSizeUpgradeAchievement #996 - OverrideReactionFireSlomo #1036 - OverrideEnemyFactionsAlertsOutsideVision #1094 - OverrideCanEquipImplant #1112 - GetLocalizedItemCategory #1116 - OverrideMetaHitEffect #1126 - OverrideInjuryClearingFatigueBehavior #1134 - OverrideStackedClassIcon #1150 - OverrideNegativeTraitRoll #1153 - FinalizePlayerStateForTacticalMusic #1218 - OverrideStrategyCostString #1303 - OverrideEligibleStartingRegion #1316 - PostUFOSetInterceptionTime #1354 - ShouldUnitPatrolUnderway #1406 - PostMissionIntroKismet #1509 - OverrideEffectIconColor #1547 - ModifyProjectileEnvironmentDamage","title":"Events"},{"location":"events/#events","text":"Many of the Highlander's features utilize Event Hooks .

EventID is the event name, EventData and EventSource list the types of the objects passed along, and NewGameState describes whether there is a NewGameState provided in the TriggerEvent call. If the EventData is an XComLWTuple , the \"Tuple contents\" paragraph lists the type and name of every variable passed using the tuple, along with its direction: An in variable has a meaningful value when the event is triggered, and mods may read it, usually to inspect the default value the game has determined. If a variable is not in , it may not be initialized when read from. An out variable will be read from by the game after all event listeners have been executed, usually with the expectation that a mod may have changed it to control some behaviors of the game. If a variable is not out , assigning to it is a no-op. An inout variable has a meaningful default value and will be read from after the event listeners have been executed. Note that exchanging data through an XComLWTuple requires subscribing to the event with the ELD_Immediate deferral. The \"Listener template\" is a copy-pasteable function that you can copy into your own mod as a starting point for using the event. Note: It is highly recommended that you use the CHEventListenerTemplate to subscribe to such events, as it is robust against history changes and allows you to provide the ELD_Immediate deferral.

Unfortunately, the order in which the DLC hooks of mods are executed (\"run order\") depends on load order, which is not guaranteed . However, run order can matter a lot. Consider a mod that creates copies of guns with different visuals: This mod really wants to run after mods that make changes to specific guns (e.g. stat changes) so that the changes translate to the copies. The CHL Run Order system provides two ways for mods to specify their position within the run order.

The DLCIdentifier is case-sensitive . Run Order is about DLCInfos, not individual mods, and a mod may have an X2DLCInfo that runs before a certain other X2DLCInfo and another that runs after that other one. Coarse (RunPriorityGroup) RunPriorityGroup is a coarse way for DLCInfos to control when they run. RunPriorityGroup can have three different values: RUN_STANDARD , RUN_FIRST and RUN_LAST . RUN_STANDARD is the default. All DLCInfos with RUN_FIRST always run before all RUN_STANDARD ones, and all DLCInfos with RUN_LAST always run after all RUN_STANDARD ones. A DLCInfo with RunPriorityGroup=RUN_LAST already runs after the vast majority of other DLCInfos. Fine (RunBefore/RunAfter) Within these groups, DLCInfos can specify which other DLCInfos they run before and after. [A] +RunBefore=\"B\" is equivalent to specifying [B] +RunAfter=\"A\" . If A and B were in a different RunPriorityGroup , their relative RunBefore / RunAfter lines would be ignored. Errors The Highlander catches some potential configuration errors and writes them to the log. Warnings and errors are printed to the log, errors are shown to the user in combination with a list of DLCIdentifiers whose authors they should report the error to. It is a warning for a DLCInfo B to RunAfter a DLCInfo A, or A to RunBefore B, if A is in an earlier RunPriorityGroup than B, since these config lines are redundant and always fulfilled. It is an error for a DLCInfo B to RunAfter a DLCInfo A, or A to RunBefore B, if A is in a later RunPriorityGroup than B, since these config lines are contradictions and never fulfilled. It is an error for any number of DLCInfos to cause a cycle, since cycles have no solution that fulfills all requirements. The console command CHLDumpRunOrderInternals can be used to print all the information the CHL has about X2DownloadableContentInfo classes to the log, for debugging purposes. One configuration error that can't be caught is a missing DLCIdentifier . If your X2DownloadableContentInfo subclass specifies a custom config file via config(CustomConfig) , then the DLCIdentifier needs to go in XComCustomConfig.ini , while the CHDLCRunOrder still goes in XComGame.ini . Splitting DLCInfo Sometimes it can be useful to split your DLC Infos into two different classes, one containing all changes that can run whenever ( RUN_STANDARD ) and one that needs to make its changes last.

Note that the pawn mesh itself never has any geometry except for a possible head. In more concrete terms, the standard human pawn meshes have their head included, and the head archetypes reference the same mesh. The Human Pawn recognizes this and doesn't actually attach a head, and instead aliases the head component to the pawn component so that all changes to the head customization apply to the mesh. Sparks on the other hand have the option to switch between different head meshes, and the head mesh never references the pawn mesh. The pawn mesh is entirely void of geometry. The Human Pawn recognizes this and uses a separate mesh component for the head. Where it all goes wrong is when those two types of heads are being mixed. The Human Pawn first aliases the head to the pawn, and when a custom head is being used, it changes the head mesh -- and, due to the alias, also the base pawn mesh. Even worse, it tries to attach the pawn to the pawn itself instead of the head to the pawn. This generally crashes the game. The fix We handle the case where we go from a standard head to a custom head correctly and don't crash We apply an invisible material to the entire pawn mesh when a custom head is being used For Sparks, this causes no change in behavior because the Spark pawn has no geometry For Humans, this is desired because otherwise, the base head clips with any custom head An invisible material is used because outright hiding the pawn turns off parts of the animation system =) Additional nice-to-have Some mod-added heads don't work well with certain customization categories.

The Highlander will show popups for missing requirements and detected incompatibilities. Terminology We'll need to distinguish a few identifiers in mod project setups to explain this feature, so here's a short rundown. DLCName is the actual ID of the mod. It's always the base name of the .XComMod file, so YetAnotherF1.XComMod has a DLCName of YetAnotherF1 . This is also the name that mod launchers specify in the ActiveMods list, and the way the game knows how to load that mod. Every mod has exactly one DLCName. Mods with the same DLCName can only be enabled or disabled together. The game stores the DLCName in the save file, and shows a warning upon attempting to load a save file when it had recorded a mod that's no longer enabled. DLCNames are case-insensitive. DLCIdentifier is an identifier corresponding to a X2DownloadableContentInfo class. Every mod has zero, one, or several X2DownloadableContentInfo classes, and the DLCIdentifier may be empty for any of them. This DLCIdentifier is used for some customization aspects (like part icons or slider names) and narrative content options (for the official DLCs). It's also used in CHL's Run Order since Run Order is all about X2DownloadableContentInfo classes. DLCIdentifiers are generally case-sensitive. In the default ModBuddy mod project, the mod has exactly one X2DownloadableContentInfo subclass with a DLCIdentifier identical to the DLCName. However, config-only mods have no X2DownloadableContentInfo at all, and some mods may have one but misconfigured the class so that the DLCIdentifier is empty. CHModDependency Now for the actual feature: Let's call the information about a mod provided to the dependency checker dependency info , or DepInfo . A mod declares dependency info through configuration entries for a class of type CHModDependency in XComGame.ini . Let's look at an example upfront (taken from Musashi's RPG Overhaul ): [XCOM2RPGOverhaul CHModDependency] DisplayName=\"Musashis RPG Overhaul\" +IncompatibleMods=\"NewPromotionScreenbyDefault\" +IncompatibleMods=\"DetailedSoldierListWOTC\" +IncompatibleMods=\"ABetterBarracksTLE\" +IncompatibleMods=\"ABetterBarracks\" +IncompatibleMods=\"ViewLockedSkillsWotc\" +IncompatibleMods=\"AddMintToMyChocolate\" +IncompatibleMods=\"RevisedWeaponUpgrades\" +RequiredMods=\"WOTC_LW2SecondaryWeapons\" +RequiredMods=\"PrimarySecondaries\" +RequiredMods=\"BetterSecondWaveSupport\" +IgnoreRequiredMods=\"NewPromotionScreenbyDefault\" +IgnoreRequiredMods=\"ViewLockedSkillsWotc\" +IgnoreRequiredMods=\"DetailedSoldierListWOTC\" CHModDependency is the class that contains our DepInfo. That class is perobjectconfig , so we can provide unique configuration for differently named instances of the class. In this case, since the DLCName of RPGO is XCOM2RPGOverhaul , we use that in the header. DisplayName is a human-readable name of the mod. This is used for the actual popup that says for example \"Musashis RPG Overhaul detected INCOMPATIBLE mods\". IncompatibleMods is a list of DLCNames that should not be enabled together with this mod. For every mod with an enabled incompatible mod, there will be a popup that lists all enabled incompatible mods. RequiredMods is a list of DLCNames that should be enabled together with this mod. For every mod with a missing required mod, there will be a popup that lists all missing requirements. IgnoreRequiredMods is a list of DLCNames that should be considered enabled if this mod is enabled. For example, RPGO integrates NewPromotionScreenbyDefault , so another mod should not consider NewPromotionScreenbyDefault missing if RPGO is enabled. There also is a IgnoreIncompatibleMods list of DLCNames that I am unfortunately not qualified to present a use case for. What +IgnoreIncompatibleMods=\"SomeDLCName\" does is silence any warning that a third mod would throw if it listed +IncompatibleMods=\"SomeDLCName\" . If you think this is useful in any way, please tell us about it in HL issue #967 . This is what the popup for missing requirements looks like: Since the missing requirements aren't enabled, we don't have any info about their DisplayName. How the dependency checker retrieves dependency info The dependency checker looks at the config objects from All currently enabled DLCNames All non-empty DLCIdentifiers from found X2DownloadableContentInfo classes while ignoring duplicates. Note that only DLCNames are supported for IncompatibleMods , RequiredMods etc., you cannot specify a requirement on or incompatibility with a given DLCIdentifier! This means that mods can easily provide dependency info for other mods -- the config object will be ignored if the corresponding DLCName isn't enabled. This also allows mods to add friendly names for other mods so that even if the mod isn't installed or doesn't set a DisplayName , the popup doesn't only show an internal ID. For example, AddMintToMyChocolate doesn't participate in the CHL depencency checker at all, but this DLCName is kind of confusing and a reported incompatibility would leave users unable to figure out what the actual conflict is. RPGO could add this to its XComGame.ini so that the name becomes clearer: [AddMintToMyChocolate CHModDependency] DisplayName=\"Classless XCOM: MINT\" and the popup would display that incompatibility as \"Classless XCOM: MINT (AddMintToMyChocolate)\". The same system can also be used to provide a DisplayName for requirements that may be missing and as such can't inform the dependency checker about their DisplayName. If the user presses \"Do not show me this again\", the Highlander will store the object name (DLCName or DLCIdentifier, depending on how the dependency checker found it in the first place) of the mod that provides this data in a user config file ( %USERPROFILE%/Documents/My Games/XCOM 2 War of the Chosen/XComGame/Config/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander_NullConfig.ini ) and won't show this popup again.

DLCName is the actual ID of the mod. It's always the base name of the .XComMod file, so YetAnotherF1.XComMod has a DLCName of YetAnotherF1 . This is also the name that mod launchers specify in the ActiveMods list, and the way the game knows how to load that mod. Every mod has exactly one DLCName. Mods with the same DLCName can only be enabled or disabled together. The game stores the DLCName in the save file, and shows a warning upon attempting to load a save file when it had recorded a mod that's no longer enabled. DLCNames are case-insensitive. DLCIdentifier is an identifier corresponding to a X2DownloadableContentInfo class. Every mod has zero, one, or several X2DownloadableContentInfo classes, and the DLCIdentifier may be empty for any of them. This DLCIdentifier is used for some customization aspects (like part icons or slider names) and narrative content options (for the official DLCs). It's also used in CHL's Run Order since Run Order is all about X2DownloadableContentInfo classes. DLCIdentifiers are generally case-sensitive. In the default ModBuddy mod project, the mod has exactly one X2DownloadableContentInfo subclass with a DLCIdentifier identical to the DLCName. However, config-only mods have no X2DownloadableContentInfo at all, and some mods may have one but misconfigured the class so that the DLCIdentifier is empty.","title":"Terminology"},{"location":"misc/ModDependencyCheck/#chmoddependency","text":"Now for the actual feature: Let's call the information about a mod provided to the dependency checker dependency info , or DepInfo . A mod declares dependency info through configuration entries for a class of type CHModDependency in XComGame.ini . Let's look at an example upfront (taken from Musashi's RPG Overhaul ): [XCOM2RPGOverhaul CHModDependency] DisplayName=\"Musashis RPG Overhaul\" +IncompatibleMods=\"NewPromotionScreenbyDefault\" +IncompatibleMods=\"DetailedSoldierListWOTC\" +IncompatibleMods=\"ABetterBarracksTLE\" +IncompatibleMods=\"ABetterBarracks\" +IncompatibleMods=\"ViewLockedSkillsWotc\" +IncompatibleMods=\"AddMintToMyChocolate\" +IncompatibleMods=\"RevisedWeaponUpgrades\" +RequiredMods=\"WOTC_LW2SecondaryWeapons\" +RequiredMods=\"PrimarySecondaries\" +RequiredMods=\"BetterSecondWaveSupport\" +IgnoreRequiredMods=\"NewPromotionScreenbyDefault\" +IgnoreRequiredMods=\"ViewLockedSkillsWotc\" +IgnoreRequiredMods=\"DetailedSoldierListWOTC\" CHModDependency is the class that contains our DepInfo. That class is perobjectconfig , so we can provide unique configuration for differently named instances of the class. In this case, since the DLCName of RPGO is XCOM2RPGOverhaul , we use that in the header. DisplayName is a human-readable name of the mod. This is used for the actual popup that says for example \"Musashis RPG Overhaul detected INCOMPATIBLE mods\". IncompatibleMods is a list of DLCNames that should not be enabled together with this mod. For every mod with an enabled incompatible mod, there will be a popup that lists all enabled incompatible mods. RequiredMods is a list of DLCNames that should be enabled together with this mod. For every mod with a missing required mod, there will be a popup that lists all missing requirements. IgnoreRequiredMods is a list of DLCNames that should be considered enabled if this mod is enabled. For example, RPGO integrates NewPromotionScreenbyDefault , so another mod should not consider NewPromotionScreenbyDefault missing if RPGO is enabled. There also is a IgnoreIncompatibleMods list of DLCNames that I am unfortunately not qualified to present a use case for. What +IgnoreIncompatibleMods=\"SomeDLCName\" does is silence any warning that a third mod would throw if it listed +IncompatibleMods=\"SomeDLCName\" . If you think this is useful in any way, please tell us about it in HL issue #967 . This is what the popup for missing requirements looks like: Since the missing requirements aren't enabled, we don't have any info about their DisplayName.","title":"CHModDependency"},{"location":"misc/ModDependencyCheck/#how-the-dependency-checker-retrieves-dependency-info","text":"The dependency checker looks at the config objects from All currently enabled DLCNames All non-empty DLCIdentifiers from found X2DownloadableContentInfo classes while ignoring duplicates. Note that only DLCNames are supported for IncompatibleMods , RequiredMods etc., you cannot specify a requirement on or incompatibility with a given DLCIdentifier! This means that mods can easily provide dependency info for other mods -- the config object will be ignored if the corresponding DLCName isn't enabled. This also allows mods to add friendly names for other mods so that even if the mod isn't installed or doesn't set a DisplayName , the popup doesn't only show an internal ID. For example, AddMintToMyChocolate doesn't participate in the CHL depencency checker at all, but this DLCName is kind of confusing and a reported incompatibility would leave users unable to figure out what the actual conflict is. RPGO could add this to its XComGame.ini so that the name becomes clearer: [AddMintToMyChocolate CHModDependency] DisplayName=\"Classless XCOM: MINT\" and the popup would display that incompatibility as \"Classless XCOM: MINT (AddMintToMyChocolate)\". The same system can also be used to provide a DisplayName for requirements that may be missing and as such can't inform the dependency checker about their DisplayName. If the user presses \"Do not show me this again\", the Highlander will store the object name (DLCName or DLCIdentifier, depending on how the dependency checker found it in the first place) of the mod that provides this data in a user config file ( %USERPROFILE%/Documents/My Games/XCOM 2 War of the Chosen/XComGame/Config/X2WOTCCommunityHighlander_NullConfig.ini ) and won't show this popup again.","title":"How the dependency checker retrieves dependency info"},{"location":"misc/ModDependencyCheck/#source-code-references","text":"CHModDependency.uc:1-122 X2WOTCCH_ModDependencies.uc:1","title":"Source code references"},{"location":"misc/ModifyEarnedSoldierAbilities/","text":"ModifyEarnedSoldierAbilities Tracking Issue: #409 This allows mods to add to or otherwise modify earned abilities for units.

The CHOnInputDelegateImproved delegate defines the signature of the callback function called when the targeted screen would receive input. Your function will be called with three arguments: The screen that would have received the input ( Screen ), the button that was pressed ( iInput ), and the action that occured ( ActionMask , button press/release). The button and action are numeric values that correspond to constants in UIUtilities_Input.uc . If your function returns true, the ScreenStack will consider the input handled and immediately stop processing the input event. If your function returns false, the ScreenStack will continue calling other subscribers and, if unhandled, will finally notify the screen itself. You can manually unsubscribe from receiving input, but this is generally not necessary as your callback will only be called when the screen would have received input and will automatically be unsubscribed upon removal of the targeted screen.

That means you have to use XComLWTuple for community highlander hooks that rely on it. LWTuple can be used to pass information between two mods without those mods needing to share any additional class types. Typically this information is passed using the XCOM2 event system: an event trigger passes an LWTuple as the EventData, and the listeners can retrieve this LWTuple. Data can be passed in both directions through this system, and the only type they both need to know about is LWTuple. LWTuples contain an id (a name) and an array of LWTValue values. The name is arbitrary and can be used to allow the sender and receiver to validate they are working with the tuple they are expecting. The data array holds the actual data to pass. LWTValue values are a union-like structure, similar to the ASValue struct used by the Scaleform system. A value can hold a bool, int, float, string, name, or object. Values are used by setting the field corresponding to the type you wish to store (e.g. i for int) and setting the kind field to the corresponding enum value (LWTVInt in this case). Readers should read only the field corresponding to the kind set in the value. To use a tuple with the event system, the code firing the event should \"new\" a LWTuple, set its ID field to an appropriate name, optionally fill in any information needed by the event listeners, and pass it as the EventData for the event. Listeners should cast the EventData back to a LWTuple, validate that the result is not none, that its ID is the one they are expecting, and that any contents are as expected. They can then store any new data needed into the tuple by adding to the data array before returning from the listener. These listeners should typically use ELDImmediate as their deferral mode so that the results are immediately processed and passed back to the caller, although mods may advertise longer-lived tuples that can be processed with other deferral strategies.

For example, X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim wants to show how many percentage points to-hit or to-crit different effects provide or diminish. However, the function is subtly broken in the presence of multiplicative modifiers ( MODOP_Multiplication or MODOP_PostMultiplication ), where it doesn't return the correct contribution but instead simply returns MultiplicationMod * BaseStat . This makes multiplicative modifiers unusable for eStat_Offense and eStat_CritChance . The Highlander function GetStatModifiersFixed wraps the broken function and fixes the numbers. Additionally, X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim is changed to call this modified function. Compatibility Mods that override/replace X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim:GetHitChance may undo the Highlander's changes and use the broken function.

For example, X2AbilityToHitCalc_StandardAim wants to show how many percentage points to-hit or to-crit different effects provide or diminish. However, the function is subtly broken in the presence of multiplicative modifiers ( MODOP_Multiplication or MODOP_PostMultiplication ), where it doesn't return the correct contribution but instead simply returns MultiplicationMod * BaseStat . This makes multiplicative modifiers unusable for eStat_Offense and eStat_CritChance . The Highlander function GetStatModifiersFixed wraps the broken function and fixes the numbers.

Refresher on loot tables Consider the simplified struct definitions taken from X2TacticalGameRulesetDataStructures : struct native LootTableEntry { var int Chance; var int RollGroup; var int MinCount, MaxCount; // Modifier on the chance, multiplicatively applied for each existing Item of type TemplateName acquired: // TotalChance = Chance * ChanceModPerExistingItem ^ NumExistingItems var float ChanceModPerExistingItem; // NOTE: these two are mutually exclusive, so only one should ever be filled in for a given entry var name TemplateName; var name TableRef; }; struct native LootTable { var name TableName; var array<LootTableEntry> Loots; }; When a unit template says \"hey, I drop this kind of loot\", it references a given LootTable by name. For the common random loot, a random unit is designated as a loot carrier at the start of the mission and its loot is rolled. The game then looks at the Loots entries and for every distinct RollGroup the game rolls a number in the half-open interval [0; 100[ (largest possible number is 99) to choose the item from that RollGroup . The game does this by iterating through the LootTableEntry entries with the current RollGroup and subtracting its Chance (after applying ChanceModPerExistingItem ) from the current chance. If this causes the current chance to go below 0 , this entry has been chosen and the game moves on to the next RollGroup . This has a number of non-intuitive consequences: Within the same RollGroup s, the chances are not independent; the game may choose 0 or 1 entries from that group. If the sum of chances in a RollGroup is x < 100 , there is a 100 - x percent chance that no entry is chosen and this RollGroup doesn't roll anything. If the sum of chances is x = 100 , then every entry will have a percent chance to be chosen identical to the Chance of the entry. If the sum of chances is x > 100 , then the latter entries will actually have a lower chance. Consider entries in the same roll group with chances 90 , 20 , 10 : The first entry will be chosen 9/10 times, the second 1/10 times, and the third never! We will discuss later what this means for mods. When an entry has been chosen, the game generates between MinCount and MaxCount of the item listed in TemplateName , if it is non-empty -- otherwise, the game invokes the aforedescribed algorithm recursively with the table referenced by name in TableRef . New APIs First and foremost, you need a loot table manager to work with. If you are in a place before templates are validated (template creation, OnPostTemplatesCreated ), the loot table manager doesn't exist yet and you need to operate on the ClassDefaultObject ; otherwise just request the loot table manager with the singleton accessor: // OPTC or template creation LootManager = X2LootTableManager(class'XComEngine'.static.FindClassDefaultObject(\"XComGame.X2LootTableManager\")); // Otherwise LootManager = class'X2LootTableManager'.static.GetLootTableManager(); The OPTC context is going to be the most common one, so the below documentation assumes that it's going to be used. LootTables This feature unprivates the otherwise config -only LootTables array. You can pretty much change anything there. If your code runs after OnPostTemplatesCreated returns, ensure to call InitLootTables if you add/remove/move around tables as a whole (the game maintains a name->index lookup for efficiency). RecalculateLootTableChanceStatic public static function RecalculateLootTableChanceStatic(name TableName, bool bEquallyDistributed = false); A non-static variant for the runtime context also exists: RecalculateLootTableChance Changes the chances for every entry in the table referred to by TableName so that the chances of every RollGroup add up to 100 . If bEquallyDistributed is true , all chances within a roll group will be equal, otherwise the proportions between the chances are maintained. This is a useful function for when you just want to add some items to existing roll groups of existing tables. Your items will naturally be placed at the end of the array, so according to consequence 4, your items might never be rolled. Calling this function makes sure your items will have a proportional chance to be rolled. Warning: Some of the latter functions recalculate chances for a given roll group implicitly unless opted out of. Warning: Some RollGroups have chance sums much lower than 100 so that only sometimes an item from that group drops. Carelessly calling RecalculateLootTableChance or forgetting to opt out of recalculating may cause showers of rare loot! AddEntryStatic/RemoveEntryStatic public static function AddEntryStatic(name TableName, LootTableEntry TableEntry, optional bool bRecalculateChances = true); public static function RemoveEntryStatic(name TableName, LootTableEntry TableEntry, optional bool bRecalculateChances = true); Non-static variants for the runtime context also exist: AddEntry , Remove Adds the entry to the given loot table, or removes it. Unless bRecalculateChances is set to false , also recalculates the chances for the entry's RollGroup so that they sum up to 100. AddLootTableStatic/RemoveLootTableStatic Actually, I have no idea why they exist and they probably don't do what you want them to. Don't use them.

When a PSC is no longer needed, it is returned to the pool so that it can be reused again later. To return a PSC back to the pool, the EmitterPool::OnParticleSystemFinished() function must be called, which usually happens seamlessly - the pool sets the ParticleSystemComponent::OnSystemFinished delegate to the aforementioned function when the PSC is initially borrowed from the pool (via EmitterPool::SpawnEmitter ). However, X2UnifiedProjectile overwrites the OnSystemFinished delegate with its own one after borrowing the PSC from the pool, which means the EmitterPool::OnParticleSystemFinished() is never called for these PSCs. As such, the pool is never made aware that those PSCs are ready for reuse and when a new PCS is requested, the pool has no choice but to simply create a new one, resulting in the pool getting bloated with all the PSCs ever spawned by X2UnifiedProjectile s. This bloat leads to two observable effects: endlessly increasing RAM usage and a significant performance degradation. The more projectiles are fired over the course of a mission, the worse these effects become. Frequent use of the Suppression ability or Idle Suppression mod kick the problem into overdrive. To address this bug, we manually call WorldInfo.MyEmitterPool.OnParticleSystemFinished() on PSCs in X2UnifiedProjectile when the projectile is done with them. Compability note : some particle systems cannot be returned directly after the projectile is done with the particle system - doing so destoys trails/smoke/effects that dissipate over time (e.g. rocket trails). To address this issue, we delay the return to pool (and the forced destruction of any remaining particles) by 1 minute. If this is not enough for your particle system, you can override the behaviour in XComGame.ini . Here's an example/template: [XComGame.CHHelpers] +ProjectileParticleSystemExpirationOverrides=(ParticleSystemPathName=\"SomePackage.P_SomeParticleSystem\", ExpiryTime=120) Property Value ParticleSystemPathName The full path to your ParticleSystem (what you configure with emitters in the editor) ExpiryTime Time in seconds to pass between the projectile being done with the system and its return to the pool Keep in mind that the above time (either the 1 min default or the override) is the max allowed delay - if a particle system finishes (and reports so by calling PSC.OnSystemFinished ), the delay will be aborted and the PSC will be instantly returned to the pool. As such, there is no need/reason to manually set lower expiration times than the default - just make sure that your particle system is properly configured in the editor. Mods that create Particle System Components using the Emitter Pool must carefully handle them the same way: if the PSC's OnSystemFinished delegate is replaced, then EmitterPool::OnParticleSystemFinished() must be called for this PSC manually when the PSC is no longer needed, otherwise the same \"memory leak\" will occur. This applies to all PSCs using the Emitter Pool, not just those in X2UnifiedProjectile .
